It has been shown that the reperfusion therapy significantly improves the clinical outcome. Currently the optimal strategy is the primary angioplasty with stent implantation. The treatment is recommended by AHA/ACC and ESC if can be performed within 90 minutes from the first medical contact. However there is still a certain percentage of procedure failure. To further improve the outcome new techniques and devices are tested . Aspiration thrombectomy may facilitate the reperfusion by reducing thrombus burden. The aim of the study is to assess if adjunctive thrombectomy may improve clinical outcome in patients with an acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.",

Recent advances in MRI have the potential to reveal new insights into the evolution and functional significance of myocardial injury and repair.\n\nHere, we will study at least 300 consecutive patients with acute ST elevation MI (STEMI) and focus on oedema, scar and bleeding in the heart using MRI in patients managed by emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Cardiac MRI scans will be performed at 1.5 Tesla (MAGNETOM, Siemens Healthcare). MRI will be used to assess initial heart function and injury. Myocardial salvage and haemorrhage are prioritised outcomes. Novel MRI methods will also be used to quantify the extent of myocardial jeopardy representing the initial area-at-risk (AAR), and the nature of this injury (strain, haemorrhage). The MRI methods will include T1, T2 and T2* relaxometry (mapping). Secondly, we will assess coronary artery disease severity by angiography and coronary artery function at the time of the heart attack treatment using a pressure-sensitive coronary guidewire (St Jude Medical). This wire can be used instead of the usual coronary wire and can provide information on heart injury, which can be linked in turn to the MRI findings. All of this information will be linked with health outcomes in the longer term.\n\nWe hypothesise that myocardial salvage, oedema, haemorrhage, and strain as revealed by MRI, have functional and prognostic significance. In all patients MRI will be performed at baseline (~day 2) and again at 6 months. In a subgroup of 30 patients, MRI will be performed on days <12 hours, and days 2, 7-10 days and 6 months post-MI. A blood and urine sample and quality of life will be obtained at baseline and at 6 months post-MI. Clinical outcomes (e.g. rehospitalisation, death) will be assessed at the end of the study (minimum 1 year) and again during longer term follow-up (minimum 3 years, maximum 20 years) by electronic linkage through central National Health Service (NHS) and government health records in order to determine the long-term prognostic significance of our initial observations with angiography, MRI and the pressure wire. The main statistical analyses will be conducted by an independent trials unit statistician.",

The nature and significance of heart injury after a heart attack is incompletely understood. We propose a 'natural history' study of heart attack injury using contemporary MRI methods. In a large hospital in the West of Scotland, heart attack patients will be invited to have at least two MRI scans and also continue with life-long follow-up. The results from the MRI scans will be assessed with all of the other clinical information obtained at the time of the heart attack and during follow-up. The results of our study should provide new insights into heart attack injury and these results should help improve how heart attack patients should be treated.",

All patients will be assessed by a member of the study team during their index admission and will undergo a detailed assessment of their coronary anatomy with either computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), CT calcium scoring and non-invasive fractional flow reserve assessment (CT-FFR) or invasive coronary angiography with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR). The pattern of myocardial injury and its functional consequence will be evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. The investigators will determine the kinetics of cardiac troponin release using serial testing at multiple time points throughout admission, and quantify other proteins and the expression of long non-coding RNA and associated mRNA to identify differences related to the presence of coronary artery disease, which may help to identify new biomarkers.",

This differentiates between myocardial infarction due to plaque rupture (type 1) and myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance (type 2) in other acute illnesses. However, these guidelines have not been widely adopted as the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction are not clearly defined. Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction have poor long term outcomes, with at least twice the mortality at five years compared to those with an index type 1 myocardial infarction. Despite the majority of deaths being attributable to non-cardiovascular events, the rate of future type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death is similar regardless of index classification. If this future risk is related to the presence of underlying coronary artery disease, then there may be the potential to improve outcomes through targeted investigation and secondary prevention. The investigators will undertake a systematic evaluation of the mechanism of myocardial injury and the role of coronary artery disease in 100 patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations where the diagnosis is likely to be type 2 myocardial infarction. These studies will help improve the assessment of patients with myocardial injury, refine the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction, and aid the design of future therapeutic trials.",

When compared to bare metal stents, sirolimus-eluting stents were associated with less restenosis and target vessel revascularization (TVR) up until one year of follow-up. , At present, it is unclear whether this also holds for paclitaxel-eluting stents.4,\n\nEverolimus is a sirolimus analogue, an effective anti-proliferative agent that inhibits growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest in the late G1 stage in the cell cycle.\n\nThe objective of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System versus a modified cobalt chromium balloon expandable stent in the setting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention for treatment of patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.\n\nThis study is a prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, two-arm, multi center clinical evaluation. A total of 1500 patients will be enrolled in the study.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the combined endpoint of Composite endpoint of all-cause death, any myocardial infarction and any revascularization at 1 year (patient oriented endpoint suggested by the ARC definitions).\n\nThe following secondary endpoints will be examined:\n\nAll cause and cardiac mortality at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years.\nRecurrent myocardial infarction at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years.\nTarget lesion revascularization at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years.\nTarget vessel revascularization at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years.\nStent thrombosis (according to the new definitions proposed by the Academic Research Consortium) at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years.\nClinical device success\nClinical procedure success.\nMajor and minor bleeding at 1 year and yearly up to 5 years.",

The majority of patients do not have a heart attack (myocardial infarction), and may be safely discharged from the Emergency Department.\n\nThe investigators propose to evaluate whether the use of the HighSTEACS pathway in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome reduces length of stay and allows more patients to be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. This pathways utilizes high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I testing and will rule out myocardial infarction if troponin concentrations are <5 ng/L on presentation, with further testing indicated at 3 hours only in those presenting early or with troponin concentrations between 5 ng/L and the 99th centile.\n\nIn six secondary and tertiary centres across Scotland, the investigators will introduce the pathway as part of a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. Sequential hypothesis testing will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the pathway. The primary efficacy end-point will be length of stay from time of presentation until final hospital discharge and the primary safety end-point will be survival free from type 1 or 4b myocardial infarction or cardiac death from discharge to 30 days. The study population will consist of those patients with cardiac troponin concentrations within the normal reference range (<99th centile) at presentation.",

The basic premise is that AMI leads to systemic inflammation that includes inflammation in the brain. The PET tracer [18F]DPA-714 binds to the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO, also known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) in the mitochondria of activated microglia/macrophages and provides a non-invasive measure of neuroinflammation. The estimates of brain TSPO binding in patients with recent AMI will be compared to a matched group of patients who have undergone a recent elective PCI procedure.",

This study may help physicians and researchers better understand the role of brain inflammation in heart disease and develop new treatments to protect the brain.",

Beginning first with thrombolytic therapy for AMI, and more recently with growing acceptance and availability of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation AMI, the mortality rates of this devastating ischemic event have decreased from almost 15% in clinical trials in the late 1980's to <5% in recent primary percutaneous coronary intervention trials. Though AMI-related mortality has been reduced, AMI survival is often accompanied by significant loss of function that may lead to subsequent treatments, congestive heart failure (CHF) and reduction in quality of life. A cell therapy that could reduce the damage associated with AMI and positively affect heart function would provide substantial benefits to the AMI patient.",

We hypothesize that patients treated with stem cell therapy will have beneficial effects on left ventricular (LV) remodeling and functional regeneration after MI and successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in setting of prospective randomized controlled trial.\n\nCongestive heart failure (CHF), which is most commonly caused by acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is the most frequent cause of hospitalization in the United States in patients over the age of 65. Although current pharmacotherapy can inhibit neurohormonal activation, this falls short in preventing LV remodeling and the development of CHF. Stem cells are undifferentiated pluripotent cells that can be obtained from the patient and have the potential to proliferate and differentiation into cardiomyocytes. The majority of the data on stem cell transplantation comes from preclinical animal studies. Although the results are interesting and perhaps safe, early phase I clinical studies are small and are very preliminary. Data from large, randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the short and long term effects of cellular cardiomyoplasty.",

However, up to 25-50% of patients who have angioplasty may have ongoing damage to the heart muscle when the blockage is opened and blood flow is restored. Complications which may result from this ongoing damage include a larger area of damaged muscle in the heart, enlargement of the heart, an increased risk of death, and an increased risk of heart failure. Some of the ongoing damage may involve increased levels of the protein kinase C (PKC) enzyme. KAI-9803 is a selective inhibitor of delta PKC. In this study, delta PKC is used with angioplasty and other standard procedures to restore blood flow after a heart attack. This study is designed to evaluate safety of different amounts of KAI-9803 when used in treating heart attack patients undergoing angioplasty. We will also try to evaluate whether KAI-9803 can reduce the amount of heart muscle damage and the complications that may occur in these patients.",

The body naturally makes a protein called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that may protect the heart muscle cells from dying and may prevent heart failure or lessen the damage that occurs. IGF-1 is also available as a drug called mecasermin. In this study, heart attack patients will be given either a dose of mecasermin or a placebo (inactive treatment) after their coronary artery has been opened by a stent. The purpose of the study will be to evaluate the safety of the therapy and to test if the therapy will prevent or lessen heart failure by evaluating a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken one day and eight weeks after the heart attack.",

Efficacy will be assessed by measurements of both the angiographic characteristics of the culprit lesion as well as by measurements of epicardial flow and myocardial perfusion in the territory of the infarct-related artery. This study will also evaluate the safety of administering low-dose IC tenecteplase to subjects undergoing primary PCI for STEMI treated with standard therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors). Safety endpoints include the incidence of death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), abrupt vessel closure, subacute stent thrombosis, and TIMI major and minor bleeding events.\n\nPrompt reperfusion therapy with primary PCI in patients with STEMI improves clinical outcomes through salvage of myocardial tissue. The proposed pilot trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive low-dose IC tenecteplase in conjunction with standard medical therapy during primary PCI for STEMI. We hypothesized that low-dose IC tenecteplase will enhance fibrinolysis at the site of the culprit lesion leading to reduced microvascular dysfunction. As reduced dose tenecteplase will be injected directly into the coronary artery increasing local concentration of the drug with minor systemic effects, an improved safety profile is also expected from this mode of administration.",

However, up to 25-50% of patients who have angioplasty may have ongoing damage to the heart muscle when the blockage is opened and blood flow is restored. Complications which may result from this ongoing damage include a larger area of damaged muscle in the heart, enlargement of the heart, an increased risk of death, and an increased risk of heart failure. Some of the ongoing damage may involve increased levels of the protein kinase C (PKC) enzyme. KAI-9803 is a selective inhibitor of delta PKC. In this study, delta PKC is used with angioplasty and other standard procedures to restore blood flow after a heart attack. This study is designed to evaluate safety of different amounts of KAI-9803 when used in treating heart attack patients undergoing angioplasty. We will also try to evaluate whether KAI-9803 can reduce the amount of heart muscle damage and the complications that may occur in these patients.",

Current management strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect: ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out. The investigators therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of intracoronary autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived human MSCs in patients with AMI.",

The heart muscle may weaken, causing heart failure. The body naturally makes a protein called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that may protect the heart muscle cells from dying and may prevent heart failure or lessen the damage that occurs. IGF-1 is also available as a drug called mecasermin. In this study, heart attack patients will be given either a dose of mecasermin or a placebo (inactive treatment) after their coronary artery has been opened by a stent. The purpose of the study will be to evaluate the safety of the therapy and to test if the therapy will prevent or lessen heart failure by evaluating a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken one day and eight weeks after the heart attack.",

In this trial the null hypothesis is that there is no effect of EPO on myocardial infarct size, the alternative hypothesis is that EPO reduces myocardial infarct size.\n\n124 subjects with acute ST-elevation MI who fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria and give informed consent to participate in the study will be recruited from patients referred to the cardiac catheterisation laboratories at the Hammersmith Hospital and King's College Hospital. Subjects will undergo primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty (primary PCI) according to standard clinical protocols. Subjects will be randomised to either placebo or EPO at the time of primary PCI. EPO will be given as a bolus of 12ml containing 33,000U over 30 mins via a peripheral vein followed by an infusion of 24ml containing 67,000 U over 12 hours. Placebo will be identical to EPO without the active ingredient. After the PCI subjects will receive standard care on the coronary care unit. An additional 20ml of blood will be taken each day at the time of routine clinical venesection for storage and subjects will have gadolinium enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) performed before discharge to evaluate infarct size. Follow-up will be performed at 30 days (clinical, ECG and 20ml blood sample) and at 90 days (clinical, ECG and CMR scan and blood sample). The study will end at 90 days and patients will continue with standard clinical care under the direction of a consultant cardiologist.\n\nCMR will be performed in the Robert Steiner MR Unit/Imaging Department, Hammersmith Hospital using a 1.5 tesla scanner according to standard protocols. Each scan will last about 1h and information will be collected on tissue characteristics, left ventricular function, wall motion abnormalities, myocardial perfusion. Myocardial infarcts will be detected by late contrast gadolinium enhancement. Gadolinium will be used at doses up to 0.2mmol/kg and is safe with an incidence of mild and transient side effects including headache and nausea of ~1%. Scans will be performed with under continuous ECG monitoring with a doctor and at least 1 other person present. Resuscitation facilities will be available at all times and the MRI facility is covered by an experienced 24 hour a day cardiac arrest team.",

Recent studies in animals have shown that EPO has protective effects when organs such as the heart and brain are injured by lack of oxygen due to reduced blood supply.\n\nWe wish to test the idea that giving a patient, who is having a heart attack, an injection of EPO will reduce the size of the heart attack.",

A brief synopsis of the AMIHOT experience is provided below, followed by a description of the AMIHOT II study.\n\nThe pivotal AMIHOT clinical study for the TherOx\u00ae Aqueous Oxygen (AO) System in treating post acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients was approved by FDA on January 10, 2002 under IDE G980257/S011. The study objective was to determine whether the adjunctive administration of AO Therapy immediately after successful PCI in a group of patients presenting less than 24 hours from AMI symptom onset improves left ventricular function and reduces the area of infarction, with no increased incidence of 30-day Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) when compared to a control group receiving only PCI standard-of-care treatment. 30-day MACE comprises the combined incidence of death, reinfarction, target vessel revascularization, and stroke.\n\nTwo hundred eighty-nine (289) patients were enrolled from January 16, 2002 through December 24, 2003, including 20 run-in subjects and 269 randomized patients. Three independent biomarkers (infarct size reduction, regional wall motion score improvement at three months, and reduction in ST segment elevation) were designated as co-primary endpoints to evaluate the effectiveness of AO Therapy. The study was designed to demonstrate superiority of the AO Therapy group as compared to controls for each of these endpoints, and to demonstrate non-inferiority of the AO Therapy group as compared to Control with respect to 30-day MACE. The study population was comprised of qualifying AMI patients treated with either PCI alone or with AO Therapy as an adjunct to successful PCI within 24 hours of symptom onset.\n\nThe observed 30-day MACE rates were comparable between the AO Therapy and Control groups. The AMIHOT trial results revealed positive trends for the overall study population in favor of the AO Therapy test group in each of the three co-primary endpoints. These favorable results did not demonstrate the required level of statistical significance to claim superiority. However, an examination of a pre-specified patient subset, anterior AMI subjects treated within six hours of symptom onset, showed promising results after analysis of the surrogate endpoint data, forming the basis for this IDE supplement that requests approval to conduct a new trial focused on this further defined patient population.\n\nTherOx has designed a follow-up clinical trial focused on these anterior AMI subjects treated within six hours, utilizing a Bayesian statistical design that incorporates both the existing AMIHOT data, and the new proposed AMIHOT II study data, into a hierarchical model for combined analysis.\n\nThe key differences between the proposed AMIHOT II study and the previously conducted AMIHOT trial are:\n\nFocused target patient population - anterior AMI subjects revascularized within six hours of symptom onset. (AMIHOT included patients revascularized within 24 hours of symptom onset, irrespective of location of infarct.)\nSingle effectiveness endpoint - infarct size reduction as measured by 14-day Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT imaging. (AMIHOT included 3 co-primary endpoints)\nNon-inferiority comparison of 30-day MACE rates within a 6% safety delta (AMIHOT proposed an 8% delta.)\nRandomization scheme - AMIHOT II will be randomized on a 2.8:1 (AO Therapy Group: Control Group) basis, as compared to the (1:1) randomization used in AMIHOT.\n\nThe method of administration of AO Therapy and the basic design of the AO System and AO Cartridge have not changed since the approval was granted by FDA to conduct the AMIHOT trial. The IDE number for the AMIHOT II clinical proposal is consistent with AMIHOT (G980257).",

Immediate unblocking of the obstructed heart vessel with a balloon catheter and implantation of a mesh scaffold (stent) in heart centers is warranted in these patients. Morbidity and mortality in this patient group is related to the infarct size. Therefore, there is a need to discover novel therapeutic agents which reduce myocardial infarct size and preserve the contractile heart function.\n\nLarge trials involving several thousand patients have demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with impaired heart function due to a heart attack, who received a mineralo-corticoid receptor antagonist (MRA, drug name: spironolactone). In these trials patients received the drug late, 3-14 days after the heart attack.\n\nOur proposal is to investigate whether MRA therapy administered intravenously prior to unblocking an occluded heart vessel, can reduce infarct size and as such can prevent long term sequelae of heart attacks.\n\n150 patients admitted to 4 tertiary care hospitals (Heart Hospital London, London Chest, Essex Cardiothoracic Center and Leeds General Infirmary) for heart attack will be randomly assigned to receive MRA treatment or placebo. The first dose of the MRA will be applied intravenously immediately in the catheter suite, even before re-opening of the occluded vessel. From the second day on, patients will be prescribed oral MRA treatment, as a pill, for a total of three months. Before hospital discharge and after three months, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the heart will accurately investigate the evolution of infarct (scar) size and the contractile heart function and compare the group of patients who received the MRA drug versus the placebo control group. Of note, patients with an ejection fraction <40% AND signs of heart failure OR diabetes will go on open label eplerenone according to current guidelines, instead of the study drug.\n\nThis study will give first evidence, if very early MRA treatment improves heart function and should be used as early as possible for treatment of patients after a heart attack.",

Following randomisation a strategy of early tenecteplase and additional antiplatelet and antithrombin therapy followed by catheterisation within 6-24 hours with timely coronary intervention as appropriate (or by rescue coronary intervention if required) in Group A will be compared to primary PCI performed according to local standards in Group B.\n\nThe study is exploratory in nature and will examine this medical question. The efficacy and safety endpoints as well as mixed (efficacy and safety) composite endpoints up to or before 30 days following randomisation will be evaluated.\n\nAll clinical endpoints of main interest will be assessed as single or composite endpoints for evaluation of the trial objective. All statistical tests are of exploratory nature based on descriptive p-values for formal statistical hypotheses generation.",

Current management strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect: ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out. The investigators therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of intracoronary autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived human MSCs in patients with AMI.",

This medical research study will also help determine if the combination of abciximab and reduced dose reteplase will decrease the risk of death, and reduce complications of a heart attack at 90 days compared to abciximab alone which is a standard treatment.\n\nPatients will receive either abciximab and reteplease or abciximab alone. Safety evaluations will be performed at specified intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and the occurrence and severity of adverse events as well as other study specific procedures. Patients will receive either abciximab and reteplease or abciximab and placebo into a vein in their arm for up to 12 hours.",

In order to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, current major guidelines recommend that oral treatment of \u03b2-blockers should be continued during and after hospitalization in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and without contraindications to \u03b2-blocker use.\n\nA clinically important but difficult decision on \u03b2-blocker therapy after AMI is to determine the duration of \u03b2-blocker therapy after discharge in patients without heart failure (HF) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Previous studies for long-term \u03b2-blocker therapy after AMI were inadequate to derive definite conclusion because of small sample size and potential selection bias.\n\nTherefore, the SMART-DECISION trial will investigate whether discontinuation of \u03b2-blocker after at least 1 year of \u03b2-blocker therapy is noninferior to continuation of \u03b2-blocker in patients without HF or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after AMI.",

In fact, the intensity of the inflammatory upregulation is strongly related to the incidence of recurrent coronary events. The investigators previously demonstrated that high dose potent statins can rapidly reduce plasma levels of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins and inflammatory activity in subjects during ACS. In addition, such statin treatment attenuates the post-discharge endothelial dysfunction of these patients. By inference, it is plausible to hypothesize that these beneficial effects during ACS may be intensified by an additive lowering of plasma cholesterol through the treatment with ezetimibe. So far, data is unavailable to verify this assumption. In parallel, data from animal models have suggested that both statins and ezetimibe may reduce insulin sensitivity by their effect on cholesterol content and, by this way, on insulin signaling in liver cells. In this context, the present study aims to investigate the role of the addition of ezetimibe upon statin treatment on stress-induced insulin resistance and on the time-course of the inflammatory response during the acute phase of myocardial infarction and its late effect on endothelium-dependent arterial dilation.",

                                            "description": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the leading causes of death all over the world. Even if patients with AMI survive the acute period without death, some ones would inevitably develop into chronic heart failure due to myocardial ischemia caused by segmental ventricular wall dyskinesia, myocardial remodeling, etc., which would seriously affect the prognosis of these patients. Early intensive treatment is the decisive factor to reduce the death of patients with AMI. However, the primary hospitals where patients firstly visit do not have the ability of Primary Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Intervention (PCI) the guidelines recommend. They have to transport patients to a center that has the conditions for emergency interventional treatment. But this transportation will delay a lot of time, resulting in the extension of MI area. More importantly, the thrombus load in coronary arteries would increase with time, and the implantation of stents in vessels with a large thrombus load will often lead to slow flow or no flow, which is a relative contraindication for interventional therapy.\n\nAt present, the guidelines recommend loading dose antiplatelet therapy and transport to the superior hospital for prime PCI within 2 hours if the first hospital for acute myocardial infarction does not have the conditions for emergency interventional therapy. Current guidelines recommend that thrombolytic therapy should be performed first and then transported when delivery is expected to be >2 hours to a hospital where PCI can be performed. And thrombolytic therapy is not recommended for patients who can perform PCI within <2 hours. There is a lack of clinical evidence for thrombolysis within 2 hours of first medical contact to Primary PCI. Compared with Primary PCI, early thrombolytic therapy can undoubtedly shorten the implementation time of reperfusion strategy to the maximum. For highly effective thrombolytic drugs, reperfusion time should be shortened, thrombus load should be reduced, and the size of myocardial infarction may be reduced and the prognosis of patients improved. There is a lack of clinical evidence for this. China is a developing country, whose grassroots and rural health resources are still poor. Early thrombolysis treatment plus subsequent reperfusion of interventional therapy not only conform to the Chinese characteristic, but also accord with the international research and the development direction in this field, which is worth further study.\n\nStaphylokinase (SAK) is produced by Staphylococcus aureus and it is a protein containing 136 amino acid residues. Its ability for dissolving blood clots was first discovered in 1948. Studies have shown that SAK is not directly convert plasminogen (PLG) into plasminogen (PLi), but first combines with PLG in a 1:1 ratio to form a complex. The complex can lead to the exposure of PLG active site, from single chain to double chain PLi, resulting to form an active SAK-PLI complex, which subsequently activates PLG molecules. Then PLG transforms into PLi and further dissolve the thrombus.\n\nRecombinant SAK (r-SAK) was developed in 1990 by Shanghai Institute of Plant and Biological Physiology. It is a gene recombinant drug prepared by molecular cloning of SAK gene in Escherichia coli. Its biological characteristics are very similar to natural SAK, and r-SAK is a highly fibrin-specific fibrinolysis agent. R-SAK is considered to be one of the most promising thrombolytic drugs due to its high thrombolysis activity (especially in platelet-rich arterial thrombosis), inactivation of system fibrinolysis, and few side effects. Clinical studies have shown that the efficacy of r-SAK in the treatment of AMI is better than urokinase, comparable to RT-PA, and it does not increase serious bleeding complications such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nIn terms of pharmacokinetics, r-SAK has a fast distribution and a long action time in human body. Half-lives of distribution term is 13.30\u00b12.06min and elimination term is 67.94\u00b121.39min when intravenous injection 10 mg r-SAK in 30min. A single bolus of r-SAK as early as possible during the first medical contact (such as prehospital care or primary hospitals or medical centers with conditional PCI) can maximize the time window for reperfusion therapy. R-SAK, a highly effective thrombolytic drug, may shorten the reperfusion time, reduce the size of myocardial infarction and improve the prognosis of the AMI patients.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of single bolus of r-SAK for thrombolytic therapy at the first contact with the patients who are diagnosed acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. It is hypothesized that this therapy can open the culprit artery very early and effectively, reduce thrombus load, reduce slow flow or no flow caused by subsequent PCI, and improve myocardial tissue perfusion.",
                                            "summary": "This study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, excellence clinical trial. Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomly assigned 1:1 to r-SAK group or the control group (normal saline). Emergency coronary angiography was performed and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed 5 days after surgery, followed up to 30 days.\n\nAt present, there is still a lack of clinical evidence on whether thrombolytic therapy is performed for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction <2 hours after the first medical contact and prime PCI. Compared to prime PCI, early thrombolytic therapy can undoubtedly shorten the implementation time of reperfusion strategy to the maximum. For highly effective thrombolytic drugs, it should also shorten the reperfusion time, reduce thrombotic load, possibly reduce the area of myocardial infarction and improve the prognosis of patients. In this study, normal saline was used as the control. To observe the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with single intravenous infusion of recombinant glucokinase (r-SAK) at the first time in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. And the effect of r-SAK on improving myocardial tissue level perfusion, reducing myocardial infarction size, improving cardiac function and clinical prognosis in STEMI patients.",

The study will be conducted sequentially in 3 parts:\n\nBlood will be collected from up to 10 healthy volunteers for protocol development. (Group 1).\nBlood will be collected from 20 MI patients within 24 hours of presentation at New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital Center (BHC). Neutrophil adhesion to human aortic endothelial cells, quantitative expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of neutrophils, quantitative levels of adhesion molecules on neutrophils and endothelial cells, and neutrophil metabolism, using a Seahorse Analyzer will be evaluated pre- and post-addition of in vitro colchicine. (Group 2)\nThe standard low-dose loading regimen of colchicine (1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg one hour later) will be administered to 20 patients with MI at BHC. Blood will be collected prior to drug administration, 2 to 3 hours after completion of the colchicine load, and 23 to 24 hours after the completion of the colchicine load. Neutrophil adhesion to human aortic endothelial cells, quantitative expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of neutrophils, quantitative levels of adhesion molecules on neutrophils and endothelial cells, and neutrophil metabolism will be evaluated pre- and post-addition of in vitro colchicine (exact markers will be determined based on the results of in viro studies above).

Investigators hypothesize that colchicine exerts its anti-inflammatory properties by switching the metabolism of neutrophils, thereby reducing the expression of adhesion molecules responsible for their recruitment in MI.",

Coronary angioplasty with stent implantation in conjunction with an optimal antitrombotic therapy as abciximab is now considered current standard therapy However, the incidence of stent restenosis in the setting of primary angioplasty remains particularly high, reaching a rate of 27%. A high restenosis rate causes a high re-hospitalization rate for target vessel revascularization and an ensuing increase in cost.In the last years the introduction of drug-eluting stents has drastically reduced the incidence of restenosis in patients not requiring urgent revascularization. This reduced incidence of restenosis occurs without an increase in adverse clinical events over conventional stents and has a very low rate of stent subacute thrombosis. Whether this combination of drug-eluting stents and abciximab might constitute the new optimal therapy for patients with an acute myocardial infarction is unknown. To be able to answer this question, we designed a one year coronary angiographic study in which patients with an acute myocardial infarction eligible for treatment with primary angioplasty and abciximab were randomized to receive either a rapamicine-eluting stent or a conventional bare stent.",

Several studies on rodents have reported administration of sTNFR-Fc, a scavenger of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha at the time of reperfusion would protect against ischemic/reperfusion injury. Also reports had shown that serum TNF-alpha concentration is negatively correlated with a cardioprotective cytokine adiponectin. Adiponectin (Ad) is an abundant protein hormone regulatory of numerous metabolic processes. The major intracellular pathway activated by Ad includes phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which is responsible for many of Ad's metabolic regulatory, anti-inflammatory, vascular protective, and anti-ischemic properties. The aim of the present study was to verify whether the administration of Etanercept, an FDA approved rheumatoid arthritis treating sTNFR-Fc, at the reperfusion time would protect against ischemic/reperfusion injury on patient, and effect serum adiponectin level.",

This burden is mainly due to the associated costs of medical interventions and the length of hospital stay.\n\nIt is advisable that the health system in Saudi Arabia deploy appropriate measures for the prevention and early detection of myocardial infarction among diabetic patients. Otherwise, the economic burden of cardiovascular diseases is expected to shoot up.\n\nA practical approach for referring patients with Myocardial Infarction (MI) is the modified meta-plan methodology for refereeing a patient from primary care to a cardiology clinic. This approach is recommended as an additional practical pathway for a patient with cardiovascular disease in primary care.\n\nA concentrated value assessment model (CVAM) for determining percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) levels is suggested to predict MI using accumulated sessions of ECG observation.\n\nPatients at high risk of future myocardial infarction could be identified by every optician at the eye clinic using retinal images and demographic data,\n\nResearch Questions:\n\nTo what extent does the use of a teleconsultation intervention is effective in reducing the proportion of deaths among patients with myocardial infarction who will be referred from peripheral hospital to the cardiac centre? To what extent does the use of teleconsultation is effective in increasing the proportion of stable cases with myocardial infarction who will be referred from the peripheral hospital to the cardiac centre?\n\nGeneral objective:\n\nTo estimate the effectiveness of using a teleconsultation for patients with myocardial infarction at peripheral hospitals in reducing the proportion of deaths and increasing the proportion of stable cases among referral cases.\n\nSpecific Objectives:\n\nAim 1: To compare the proportion of death among cases with myocardial infarction who will be referred from a peripheral hospital to the cardiac centre in the intervention versus the control group (routine care).\n\nAim 2: To compare the proportion of stable cases of myocardial infarction who will be referred from the peripheral hospital to the cardiac centre in the intervention versus the control group (routine care).\n\nAim 3: To compare the proportion of cases who developed co-morbidities such as heart failure in the intervention versus the control group (routine care).\n\nLiterature Review:\n\nA positive protective effect of antidepressant use to protect against developing myocardial infarction as primary care intervention is evident.\n\nResearch Design and Methods:\n\nThis is a six months clustered randomized trial that will recruit patients with provisional a diagnosis of myocardial infarction at a governmental peripheral hospital in Hail city.\n\nParticipants (P):\n\nThe participants will be adults presented to the physician at the peripheral hospital with symptoms and signs of myocardial infarction. The participants are expected to be adults aged 18 years and above. Children and young adults will be excluded. The aim is to report eligible cases by the physician at the peripheral hospital upon satisfaction with the written criteria for early MI diagnosis. The reporting will continue for six months from the beginning of the trial. Cases in both intervention and control clusters will be notified and reported regularly.",

However, ischemia reperfusion injury, inappropriate ventricular remodeling, and myocardial fibrosis may still be present in STEMI after PCI, which may be related to the inflammatory response in STEMI. Mast cells (MC), their degranulation products and induction of a series of inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the inflammatory response. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between mast cell markers (trypsin, chymotrypsin) levels and prognosis after direct PCI in STEMI patients. We prospectively and continuously included STEMI patients undergoing standard therapy after direct PCI. Clinical data and blood samples were collected and followed up for 1 year to analyze mast cell markers and myocardial infarction size. As well as differences in echocardiography, markers of two-dimensional speck tracking techniques, inflammatory factors and major adverse cardiovascular events, to explore the relationship between mast cells and their products and ventricular remodeling and ischemia-reperfusion injury in STEMI patients, and to provide new ideas for treatment and new basis for optimization of STEMI treatment strategies.",

The study will enroll a total of up to 20 patients, and will be a cooperative effort between LRS and LSU Health Sciences Center - Shreveport.\n\nThe study is being conducted under an IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) that was granted to LRS by FDA (G070141). The primary goal of this trial is to demonstrate the feasibility of cooling AMI patients pre-reperfusion with the ThermoSuit cooling device. The safety of this treatment will be determined by review of a composite of serious adverse events.\n\nConsciously sedated patients will be cooled after entry into the emergency room and prior to percutaneous coronary intervention in the catheterization laboratory. It is hypothesized that the ThermoSuit System will enable cooling of the patient to 34\u00baC after a treatment of 30 minutes or less. Previous research has suggested that cooling of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients before coronary reperfusion could result in a significant reduction in myocardial infarct size.\n\nIf successful, this study will lead to a pivotal clinical study to investigate the potential for the ThermoSuit cooling treatment to reduce myocardial infarct size. The ultimate goal of these studies is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the use of the ThermoSuit device for the treatment of AMI patients.",

Although progress has been made in this area, there is a lack of studies using up-to-date examination instruments for the calibration of MCG analysis.

Coronary lesions are measured by coronary angiography (CAG) or coronary CTA, and are defined by both the stenosis degree and the computer-simulated fraction flow reserve. Myocardial necrosis is examined and quantified by cardiac MR. Healthy volunteers, chest pain patients who will receive CAG or CTA examination, and patients with acute myocardial infarction will be enrolled in this study.",

Therefore, the involved lymphocytes represent a novel target for therapeutic interventions. However, there are no established blood-derived biomarkers to predict the quantity and quality of the adaptive immune response to cardiac injury. Multimodal imaging of the heart and immunologic organs might provide such information.\n\nRecent retrospective analysis of patients after MI revealed enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes associated with increased CXCR4 radiotracer accumulation, thereby indicating that CXCR4 PET-based lymph node imaging provides a non-invasive quantitative readout of the local adaptive immune response. These considerations are further fuelled by the fact that, within lymph nodes, CXCR4 is expressed almost exclusively on lymphocytes, whereas various other cell types express CXCR4 within the myocardium.\n\nThis leads to the hypothesis that the size of mediastinal lymph nodes and their respective CXCR4 PET signals correlate with the adaptive immune response to cardiac injury and might provide predictive information for functional cardiac decline during follow-up.\n\nThis prospective clinical study will use multimodal imaging to monitor chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression in the lymph nodes, myocardium, spleen, and bone marrow after acute MI. The combination of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), echocardiography, and positron emission tomography (PET) along with blood collection for immunophenotyping will allow to determine i) if the size of mediastinal lymph nodes and their respective PET-derived CXCR4 signals at baseline correlate with the adaptive immune response to acute cardiac injury; and ii) if they predict cardiac adverse remodelling during longitudinal follow-up.",

                                            "description": "Reperfusion Strategies in ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Network - Sao Paulo Registry.\n\nPreparation and implementation of the ST segment elevation myocardial network in Sao Paulo:\n\nInitially, in 2009 a 24-hour central office for electrocardiogram (ECG) reading was installed at Hospital S\u00e3o Paulo - Paulista School of Medicine to receive EKG's sent from 126 SAMU ambulances, covering the entire S\u00e3o Paulo city area. The ECGs were transmitted to the central office via mobile phone, fixed phone or Internet, and immediately interpreted by a team of cardiologists, by using guidelines for STEMI ECG diagnosis. The EKG reports were sent back to the mobile phone of the transmitting ambulance. With this system in place and working adequately, the Municipal Health Secretariat of S\u00e3o Paulo made the fibrinolytic agent tenecteplase (TNK) available initially in four municipal emergency rooms (ER) of large peripheral hospitals, with a previous history of receiving a large number of patients with AMI (Ermelino Matarazzo ER, Campo Limpo ER, Tatuap\u00e9 ER, and Saboya ER). The medical and nursing teams of these hospitals were trained and updated on the clinical diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes, ECG recognition of STEMI, and indications of thrombolytic agents and primary PTCA in STEMI. A direct and immediate contact, via an exclusive mobile phone line, was established between the advanced ambulances or the ERs and the Coronary Unit of Hospital S\u00e3o Paulo. Thus, a patient diagnosed with STEMI, who was at an ER or in an ambulance and could be in a catheterization laboratory in less than 90 minutes or with contra-indication to thrombolysis was referred for primary PTCA. If the advanced ambulance was very far away or if the estimated travel time for a patient at one of the ERs was longer than 90 minutes, he/she would receive TNK; after thrombolysis, the patient would be immediately transferred to Sao Paulo Hospital, and would undergo either rescue PTCA, if necessary, or cardiac catheterization within 6 to 24 hours, if clinically stable. The dose of TNK ranged from 30 mg to 50 mg, meeting the known criteria for indication and contraindication of fibrinolytic drugs. In addition to TNK, the patients received as adjuvant therapy and according to the Brazilian and international guidelines the recommended doses of morphine, low molecular weight heparin (properly corrected to weight and renal function), IV nitrates and oral medications, such as, aspirin, clopidogrel, statins and beta-blockers.\n\nAn expansion of the primary network was made in 2011 to allow 3 more ER's to be included in the network (Pirituba, Joao XXIII, Servidor Municipal) and one more in 2013 (Vila Maria), summing up at the moment 8 fixed ER units plus SAMU ambulances.\n\nAfter catheterization, patients are maintained in the tertiary hospital if they are in advanced Killip class or have left main or severe LV dysfunction and were referred back to the primary center 24 hours after cath or PCI if stable, with good LV function and 1 or 2 vessel disease.\n\nEstablishing a formal registry:\n\nSince the network's conception, a formal case report form (CRF) form was developed to collect demographics, metrics (times of performance), clinical characteristics, laboratory results, coronary angiography results and outcomes for all patients. This CRF includes now more than 100 variables that are fed exclusively for one person (administrator).\n\nData collection is made by 2 appointed medical co-workers that are responsible for the completion of the CRF and liberation for register on the electronic sheet. CRFs are kept filed with in-hospital ECGs copies.\n\nAn electronic spreadsheet (Excel\u00ae, Microsoft Corp., Santa Rosa, Calif\u00f3rnia - EUA) is maintained in a dedicated central computer at the University and updated weekly by the administrator (principal investigator).\n\nData checks for inconsistencies are made weekly by comparing results of clinical evolution and electronic data as well as information derived from \"overlapping\" columns, established in advance, containing similar data (EKG culprit and cath culprit artery, had PCI performed and type and number of stent utilized, complication yes and no complication item filled out). Source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data is done by comparing the data on the spreadsheet to official medical records if any inconsistency is suspected. A single, experienced PCI person fills out Cath data reports and TIMI and BLUSH flow. Periodic monthly meetings with the total group of professionals involved in the project, reassessing causes and the rate of death and major complications are held previous to send a report to the Municipality with these variables and also detailing where the cases did come from and what the evolution was till hospital discharge.\n\nDefinitions:\n\nAll variables included (history elements, risk factors, clinical presentation data, diagnostic procedure data elements, invasive therapeutic intervention data elements, medication data elements, and outcomes data elements) comply with definitions on \"2013 ACCF/AHA key data elements and definitions for measuring the clinical management and outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes and coronary artery disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on clinical data standards (writing committee to develop acute coronary syndromes and coronary artery disease clinical data standards). J Am Coll Cardiol. 2013 Mar 5;61(9):992-1025. doi: 10.1016/j.jacc.2012.10.005. Epub 2013 Jan 28. PubMed PMID: 23369353\".\n\nThe two pathway established routes involved going directly to the cath lab or receiving TNK and then systematically having cat performed in 3-24 hours. Of those going directly to the catheterization laboratory they didn't have PCI performed if they were found to have no or mild lesions or on the contrary to have distal left main and/or proximal three vessel disease. Additionally, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was defined as initial mechanical reperfusion during cardiac catheterization for a STEMI with no previous use of fibrinolytic drugs or glycoprotein IIB/ IIIa inhibitors. Rescue PCI was defined as an emergency cardiac catheterization due to a suspicion of ineffective thrombolysis, characterized by persistence of pain at an intensity of at least 50% of that at onset or persistence of at least 50% of ST-segment elevation on ECG in the lead maximally initially involved. Pharmaco-invasive strategy was defined as the use of full-dose chemical thrombolysis, followed by routine cardiac catheterization within 6 to 24 hours, even in stable patients with successful reperfusion, with the intention to treat the culprit lesion. After the STREAM trial results in June 2013, patients older than 75 years have received half dosage of TNK.\n\nStatistical analysis:\n\nThis study aims at prospectively collecting data, consecutively, of a large population, submitted to this double route option of STEMI treatment in which current standard medical practice is applied in an organized network. There were no specific statistical tests used when planning the study with the idea that appropriate tests would be applied when looking for specific information of all data collected. No patient to date has been refused to the Registry when the PCI hospital was contacted.\n\nData dictionary:\n\nThe variables included here are the main ones in the Registry, although some of them are further expanded in sub-items allowing more information, like for example, electrocardiographic results and catheterization characteristics. As already mentioned, definitions according to American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force or the European Society of Cardiology on clinical data standards.\n\nName Hospital ID Phone number Age (years) Gender Ethnicity Date/time of admission in the primary hospital (arrival) or ambulance Arrival facility identification Date/time of admission in the tertiary hospital TIMI /GRACE/ ZWOLLE/ CADILAC/ CRUSADE scores Symptoms onset date/time Previous symptoms First ECG date/time TeleECG TNK date/time / location (pre hospital/ ambulance/hospital) Door/needle time Pain/needle time Dual antiplatelet therapy time/type Coronary angiography Date/time; duration Door/balloon time Pain/balloon time Admission arterial blood pressure and heart rate Body Mass Index (MBI) Killip class Creatinine MDRD ECG (multiple characteristics pre and post treatment) Catheterization aspects - type of PCI performed/pharmacologic therapies before and after procedure/ complications (several options) / TIMI and BLUSH grades pre and post intervention STEMI complications Major Bleeding Minor Bleeding Blood Transfusion Ischemic CVA / TIA Hemorrhagic CVA PCR at 3ary Hospital PCR at 1ary Hospital Known Hypothyroidism Length of hospitalization Echocardiographic data Outcomes Final diagnostic Final destination Laboratory screening (arrival or peak and follow-up) - troponin CK/CKMB/ creatinine/ hemogram/ Coagulation tests/ Glucose and Hemoglobin A1c value/ TSH/T3/T4/ Lipids profile/ AST/ALT.

Successful reperfusion rates were obtained in more than 70% and complemented by invasive interventional and PCI in almost all patients. Most of them (77%) received the drug with less than 6 hours after symptoms onset and hospital mortality was 4,5% for this group, while it was around 9% for patients receiving TNK after 6 hours of pain. Again, cardiogenic shock and stroke were more frequent in the latecomers. Mortality rates for patients without cardiogenic shock were very low (under 2%). Late follow up is being proceeded.",
                                            "summary": "At the periphery of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, in-hospital mortality in acute myocardial infarction is estimated to range between 15% and 20% due to difficulties inherent to delayed answer at a large metropolis. As a city with more than 11 million inhabitants, the distribution of emergency services and public hospitals is also heterogeneous, with scarcity in peripheral zones. That heterogeneity of resources also involves the quality of the medical care provided. The possibility of a standard care with fast transfer after thrombolysis and a tertiary backing system for ECG interpretation, catheterization and advanced support could improve this setting.\n\nIn a project initiated in 2010, the S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal Health Secretariat, the Federal University of Sao Paulo/Paulista School of Medicine, the Emergency Mobile Health Care Service arranged a planed system of thrombolysis at peripheral hospitals or at the ambulances with immediate transfer to a unique tertiary center for early angiography and angioplasty of the culprit artery. The protocol uses recommendations of Brazilian and international guidelines, and is the same adopted for the management of ST elevation myocardial infarction at Paulista School of Medicine regarding the indications for thrombolytic agents, primary and rescue percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and pharmacoinvasive therapy.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is that a network to provide the best care for patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction will reduce mortality rates.\n\nThe main purpose of this registry is to provide demographics, metrics and results of this experience, maintaining complete records of clinical, laboratory and coronary angiography data of all patients allowing short-term outcome analysis of various variables in a large population. Additionally, follow-up outcomes will be provide in a sub-group of patients keeping their health care at the University or able to be tracked.\n\nAll clinical endpoints of main interest will be assessed as single or composite endpoints for evaluation at different time intervals.",

According to WHO, 30 % of deaths caused by MI could be prevented if the populations adhere to official guidelines for physical activity. However, secondary prevention trials in MI patients have been of insufficient size or quality to provide conclusive evidence that physical activity reduces the risk of death or recurrent cardiovascular diseases. NorEx is the first study able to provide such evidence.\n\nNorEx is a registry-based prospective, three-arm, randomized multicenter secondary prevention clinical trial with blinded end-point evaluation (PROBE design). The aim of the study is to investigate whether, and to what extent, moderate to high intensity supervised physical activity will reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease and death among people who have suffered a myocardial infarction. The intervention group consists of Approximately 3185 participants who will be trained to exercise for 4 years under supervision of a personal trainer. The study design includes two control groups each consisting of approximately 3200 patients.The primary composite endpoint is time to all-cause death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, whatever comes first during 4 years of follow-up. The study is powered to detect a 20 % difference in the incidence of the primary endpoint between the intervention group and the control groups. Novel health IT technology was specifically designed for NorEx, including a smart watch, a NorEx mobile application and a manager portal which allows the trainers to interact with the participants. Follow-up of the participants will be through national health registries for up to 10 years after study completion.",

COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,. Among patients with COVID-19, there is a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, and >7% of patients experience myocardial injury from the infection (22% of critically ill patients). Although angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 serves as the portal for infection, the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers requires further investigation.\n\nHowever, much like any other respiratory tract infection, pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CV risk factors enhance vulnerability to COVID-19. Further, COVID-19 can worsen underly- ing CVD and even precipitate de novo cardiac complications.\n\nPreliminary reports suggest that haemostatic abnormalities, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), occur in patients affected by COVID-19. Additionally, the severe inflammatory response, critical illness, and underlying traditional risk factors may all predispose to thrombotic events, similar to prior virulent zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks CMR is the reference non-invasive standard for cardiac function and tissue characterization and may offer an effective and efficient diagnostic imaging choice to obtain critical information for clinical decision-making.",

Recent advances in MRI have the potential to reveal new insights into the evolution and functional significance of myocardial injury and repair.\n\nHere, we will study at least 300 consecutive patients with acute ST elevation MI (STEMI) and focus on oedema, scar and bleeding in the heart using MRI in patients managed by emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Cardiac MRI scans will be performed at 1.5 Tesla (MAGNETOM, Siemens Healthcare). MRI will be used to assess initial heart function and injury. Myocardial salvage and haemorrhage are prioritised outcomes. Novel MRI methods will also be used to quantify the extent of myocardial jeopardy representing the initial area-at-risk (AAR), and the nature of this injury (strain, haemorrhage). The MRI methods will include T1, T2 and T2* relaxometry (mapping). Secondly, we will assess coronary artery disease severity by angiography and coronary artery function at the time of the heart attack treatment using a pressure-sensitive coronary guidewire (St Jude Medical). This wire can be used instead of the usual coronary wire and can provide information on heart injury, which can be linked in turn to the MRI findings. All of this information will be linked with health outcomes in the longer term.\n\nWe hypothesise that myocardial salvage, oedema, haemorrhage, and strain as revealed by MRI, have functional and prognostic significance. In all patients MRI will be performed at baseline (~day 2) and again at 6 months. In a subgroup of 30 patients, MRI will be performed on days <12 hours, and days 2, 7-10 days and 6 months post-MI. A blood and urine sample and quality of life will be obtained at baseline and at 6 months post-MI. Clinical outcomes (e.g. rehospitalisation, death) will be assessed at the end of the study (minimum 1 year) and again during longer term follow-up (minimum 3 years, maximum 20 years) by electronic linkage through central National Health Service (NHS) and government health records in order to determine the long-term prognostic significance of our initial observations with angiography, MRI and the pressure wire. The main statistical analyses will be conducted by an independent trials unit statistician.",

The nature and significance of heart injury after a heart attack is incompletely understood. We propose a 'natural history' study of heart attack injury using contemporary MRI methods. In a large hospital in the West of Scotland, heart attack patients will be invited to have at least two MRI scans and also continue with life-long follow-up. The results from the MRI scans will be assessed with all of the other clinical information obtained at the time of the heart attack and during follow-up. The results of our study should provide new insights into heart attack injury and these results should help improve how heart attack patients should be treated.",

                                            "description": "The patients were recruited on the basis of regional vascular center (RVC) of the 1st cardiology department for myocardial infarction patients of State Budget Institution of Health of Novosibirsk region \"City Clinical Hospital\" (SBUZ NSO GKB) \u2116 1 of Novosibirsk. According to the design, there were three points in the study: zero point - the first day of hospitalization of the patient in the hospital; the first point - day 30 of MI development; the second point - 12 months from the time of AMI development. At all stages of the study we performed the examinations stipulated by the standard of care for patients with acute myocardial infarction, clinical guidelines and dissertation research protocol: clinical status of the patient (evaluation of complaints, objective examination), laboratory tests (total blood count (TBC), total urine analysis (UPE), biochemical blood analysis (BX), instrumental examinations (ECG, chest radiography (RGCT)). Coronarography followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), EchoCG and determination of molecular genetic markers were also performed at stage 0. At any stage in the presence of cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities, Holter electrocardiography monitoring (HM-ECG) was performed; and a 6-minute walk test was performed at the 1st and 2nd points.\n\nVerification of the diagnosis of AMI was performed according to the criteria of the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction, which summarizes the opinion of experts of the World Heart Federation (WHF), American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC) and European Society of Cardiology (EOC, ESC) (2018). The dissertation work included patients who met the criteria for acute type 1 MI, which included elevated cardiac troponin levels above the 99th percentile of the upper reference value, in combination with at least one additional feature: 1) a characteristic clinical picture of acute myocardial ischemia; 2) new ECG changes suggestive of ischemia; 3) a pathologic Q-wave on the ECG; 4) imaging findings confirming new areas of myocardial ischemia; and 5) presence of infarct-related artery thrombosis (ICA) on CAG. Verification of the diagnosis of acute and chronic heart failure (OSF, CHF) was performed on the basis of clinical recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology (EOC, ESC) (2016, 2021), combined recommendations of the Society of Heart Failure Specialists (SHF), Russian Society of Cardiology (RSC) and Russian Scientific Medical Society of Physicians (RSMOT) (2018). The classification of CHF according to the stages of the disease (Strazhesko-Vasilenko, 1935) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was used, also the heart failure classification of the New York Heart Association (NYHA, 1964) was used to assess the severity of symptoms. We used Killip classification of acute heart failure.\n\nInstrumental methods of investigation ECG was recorded in 12 leads (6 standard and 6 thoracic leads) using \"Megacart-400\" (Siemens) in the first minutes of hospital admission, then once a day until subacute period of STEMI formed, and then once every three days. Echocardiography was performed on admission to the hospital, on the 30th day from the development of MI, and 1 year later on a Phillips ie33 device (Philips Ultrasound, USA) from the standard position, in the left side of the patient, using a 2-4 MHz ultrasound matrix transducer. The technique was performed in M- and B-modes, pulse-wave, continuous-wave Doppler, color Doppler mapping, tissue Doppler and color Doppler M-mode (Color M-mode). The following parameters were determined: PV - ejection fraction (Simpson, 1989. ), FV - end diastolic volume, CSV - end systolic volume, ESR - end systolic size, CDD - end diastolic size, FDi - end diastolic index, CSI - end systolic index, DLA - mean pulmonary artery pressure, FDD - end diastolic pressure, SW - stroke volume, MM - myocardial mass, IMM - myocardial mass index, LP - left atrium, RAP - right atrium, RV - right ventricle, VIR - isovolumic relaxation time, E - LV early diastolic filling rate, A - left ventricular late diastolic filling rate, E/A - ratio of early and late transmitral flow, DT - time of early diastolic filling slowdown, AT - time of early diastolic filling acceleration, ET - ejection period, Em - myocardial early diastolic motion rate, Am - velocity of late diastolic myocardial motion, Em/Am - ratio of velocities of early and late diastolic myocardial motion, E/e' - ratio of E-wave blood flow on mitral valve to E'-wave (ratio of early mitral valve ring motion), pulmonary vein S blood flow, pulmonary vein D blood flow, dE and dA - parameters of duration of early diastolic filling, IVCT - isovolumic time of RV contraction, Sfcmc - mitral valve fibrous ring velocity, VpvA - maximum diastolic retrograde flow velocity, SRMP - early mitral flow velocity, diastolic stiffness, Tei index - sum of isovolumetric contraction and isovolumetric relaxation times divided by ventricular ejection time, Em/SRMP - ratio of early diastolic transcuspidal flow velocity to its rate of spread. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated using the formula: LVEF = (QDO - QSO/QDO) 100% (according to Simpson's method). The presence and degree of dyskinesia of necrosis zone and scar changes, aneurysm, papillary muscle lesions and myocardial rupture zones were also determined by standard technique, in two-dimensional and one-dimensional modes and in pulse and continuous-wave Doppler Echo-CG modes. Selective CAG was performed within the first 24 hours after the patient's admission to the hospital on an INNOVA 3100 angiographic machine (USA) with access through the radial artery using standard Judkins left (Jl 4.0) and Judkins right (Jl 4.0) catheters, using X-ray contrast agents (ultravist, Gadovist). Transilluminal balloon angioplasty with stenting of the symptomatic artery was performed when hemodynamically significant stenosis exceeding 65% was diagnosed using the technique of direct stenting.\n\nPreparation of DNA preparations DNA extraction from blood was performedby phenol-chloroform extraction. Five to six volumes of buffer A (10 mMTris-HCl, pH=7.5; 10 mM NaCl; 3 mM MgCl2) were added to 1 volume of blood sample and clots were rubbed in a homogenizer. After centrifugation at 2500g for 15 min, the precipitates were washed three times with buffer A and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (10 mM EDTA; 100 mM NaCl; 50 mM Tris HCl, pH=8.5). After adding SDS to 0.5% and proteinase E to 200 \u03bcg/mL, the mixture was incubated for 12 hours at 56\u00b0C. Deproteinization was performed sequentially with phenol-chloroform mixture (1:1), water-saturated phenol,phenol-chloroform mixture (1:1), and chloroform. DNA was precipitated by adding NaCl solution to 1 M and 1 V isopropyl alcohol. After that, the solution was cooled for 1 h at -20 \u00b0C. The precipitate obtained by centrifugation on an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 12000g for 15 min was washed three times with 75% ethanol followed by centrifugation for 5 min. 12000g and, after drying at 56 \u00b0C, dissolved in deinanilized water to a DNA concentration of 0.5 \u00b5g/\u03bcl.Genotyping of polymorphisms was performed using real-time PCR according to the manufacturer's protocol (TaqMan probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) on a StepOnePlus instrument. They were selected according to the results ofinternational full genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which confirmed the association of these SNPs with coronary heart disease (CHD),development of heart failure.\n\nStatistical methods of material processing The influence of clinical, demographic, functional, biochemical, markers not and treatment methods on the development of acute, hospital and distant postinfarction chronic heart failure was assessed by odds ratio.\n\nStatistical analysis of molecular genetic data was performed using SPSS 22.0 software package. the first step was to determine the frequencies of genotypes and alleles of the studied CHF in ACS patients with elevated cardiospecific markers and in the comparison group, where cardiospecific markers were within normal limits; then we assessed the compliance of genotype frequencies with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in control group (Chi-square criterion). Comparison of the level of quantitative indices in carriers of different genotypes was performed after checking the normality of the distribution of these traits by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the traits met the criteria of normal distribution, a single-factor analysis of variance was used. Significance of differences between the two genotypic classes was additionally checked using the t-test for two independent samples. The significance of differences between the two genotypic classes was additionally tested with the Mann-Whitney test for two independent samples if the investigated trait did not meet the criteria of normal distribution, comparison of the level of this trait among the carriers of different genotypes was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The association of SNPs with risk factors related to categorical variables was tested with conjugation tables using Pearson's chi-square test. In the case of four-field tables, we compared samples by genotype and allele frequencies using Fisher's exact two-sided criterion. The risk of disease outcome/risk factor for a particular allele or genotype was calculated as odds ratio.\n\nCorrelation, factor and regression analysis methods were used to develop mathematical models for predicting the risk of postinfarct CVD. The first two groups of methods were used to identify significant independent variables (attributes) that correlate well with the probability of an adverse outcome, but weakly correlate with each other (to exclude multicollinearity of the model). Regression analysis methods were used to choose the structure of the regression model and to estimate its coefficients. Two coefficients, which have a simple interpretation, were used to test the adequacy of the constructed model:\n\nsensitivity coefficient;\nspecificity coefficient;\ncoefficient of accuracy.",
                                            "summary": "Introduction Despite significant progresses in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and the development of reperfusion treatment methods, heart failure still often complicates its course. There are three types of postinfarction heart failure: occurring in the acute period, during hospital treatment and after discharge. Factors contributing to heart failure during hospitalization for MI and after discharge include comorbidity of the patient, worsening of pre-existing CHF and comorbidities. In the last decades we can observe higher level of myocardial percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), improvement of pre-hospital care, which decreased mortality and HF; however, the proportion of HF patients with preserved ejection fraction increased. All these factors determine the urgency of the studied problem.\n\nPurpose of the study To identify the most significant factors contributing to the development of acute and subacute heart failure after myocardial infarction Materials and methods Retrospective and prospective non-randomized parallel-group analysis of 186 suffered MI (mean age 63.5 y) during one year was performed in this work, and in the main group of patients (86 patients) at 30 days after MI, chronic heart failure over 2F by NYHA was confirmed, and in comparison group (100 patients) CHF was either absent or did not exceed 2F by NYHA. The diagnosis of MI and CHF was made according to national and European guidelines. Both groups received standard therapy for CHF: ACE inhibitors/angiotensin 2/angiotensin receptor antagonists and neprolysin inhibitor (ARNI), \u03b2-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (AMCR), SGLT2-receptor inhibitors; anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, statins, diuretics if necessary were also used.\n\nOne year after discharge, clinical outcomes were assessed: cardiovascular mortality, repeated hospitalizations due to decompensation of CHF, death from other causes, stroke, repeated myocardial infarction, unscheduled coronary revascularization; telephone contacts were made every month, repeat visits to the clinic - one year later. The results were based on the information collected in the course of telephone contacts and via e-mail; hospitalizations were also monitored by querying the databases of medical institutions.",

Therefore, CARIM cohort will offer a great opportunity of describing the interactions between myocardial infarction and surrounding environment (clinical, social and professional). This cohort will use complementary state of the art approaches (cardiac imaging including Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and echocardiography, biomarkers, proteomic, genetic and pharmacogenetics) with strong interactions between the different partners. Therefore CARIM cohort should help to obtain a modeling of the determinants of the MI size.\n\nThe investigators expect that CARIM cohort will provide new imaging or biological markers that may bring early information regarding the severity of lethal reperfusion injury.\n\nBy optimizing the knowledge on infarct injury in addition with a 5-year clinical and echographic follow-up, this cohort will better stratify the prognosis after MI and will therefore give new insights in identifying patients at higher risk of left ventricular remodeling and subsequent heart failure. It will therefore help and emphasize prevention messages and patients' education. The aim is to translate this information directly into patient care by using the science generated by this project to develop new management guidelines and novel clinical tools (confounder-annotated database, imaging and biological biomarkers). This cohort may have additional impact in patient care by adapting the treatment to patient-related confounders (age, diabetes...), genetic polymorphisms and thus personalizing health care to individuals.\n\n3.2 MAIN OBJECTIVE\n\nThe investigators main objective is to create a prospective cohort of 2,000 patients (CARIM cohort) with a first myocardial infarction and undergoing reperfusion therapy in order to evaluate the impact of patient-related confounders on myocardial infarct size and LRI in order to further design a modeling of myocardial infarct size.\n\nFor this purpose, CARIM cohort will be associated with the creation of a non-invasive cardiac imaging data-bank (MRI and echocardiography) in addition with a large bio-bank relying on existing biological certified platforms (i.e. BRC network).\n\nThis cohort will provide a population of first acute MI, optimally characterized in terms of comprehensive clinical and angiography phenotype, specifically characterized by CMR in terms of infarct size and LRI and by echocardiography in terms of myocardial regional function and left ventricular remodeling.\n\n3.3 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES\n\nEvaluate the specific impact of myocardial infarct injury on myocardial regional function and left ventricular remodeling (defined by an increase in LV end-diastolic volume > 20% between week 1 and month 12 post-MI by echocardiography).\nEvaluate the power of the myocardial infarct injury in predicting cardiovascular events (rehospitalizations, reinfarction, occurrence of HF, transplantation, arrhythmias, death) in a 5-year patient follow-up.\nTest the value of established or newly identified plasma/serum biomarkers to identify LRI and to predict post-MI LV remodeling and progression towards CHF during a 5 year follow-up.\nThis cohort aims ultimately at defining the profile of the MI patient population to be used for future trials implementing new protective interventions targeting LRI.",

AMI was defined using the European Society of Cardiology / American College of Cardiology guidelines. Exclusion criteria were the following: 1) presence of mitral stenosis or prosthetic valve, 2) more than mild severity of aortic/mitral valvular problem, 3) any abnormality of atrial septum (e.g., atrial septal defect or aneurysm), 4) rhythm other than sinus rhythm and 5) lack of informed consent. Finally, 521 patients participated in this study and were under final analysis. All patients and controls gave written informed consent to participate in the study, and the study was approved by the institutional review board at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital.\n\nCardiac catheterization: Before catheterization, all patients received 300 mg of aspirin and 300 mg of clopidogrel. After detail explanation and informed consent, patients were subjected to diagnostic coronary angiography via a femoral approach following intravenous injection of unfractionated 7500 U heparin. There were 46 cases required coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with/without other repair procedures due to failed percutaneous coronary intervention procedure, severe multiple vessel disease, left main lesion, cardiac rupture, severe mitral regurgitation or post-MI ventricular septal defect. All other patients were treated successfully by primary PCI and stenting. Eight patients who had initially received primary PCI were later treated by CABG due to failure of the procedure, severe multiple vessel disease or complications (the 46 CABG patients cited above included these eight patients). Coronary angioplasty and stenting were performed for just the culprit lesion using standard techniques and bare-metal stents in all patients. The decision to use glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was left to the discretion of the treating physician. The measurements of LVFP were performed via a fluid-filled pig-tail catheter placed into the LV after coronary angiography if PCI was not indicated or after primary PCI. The LVFP was continuously recorded (50 mm/s) by a 6-F pigtail catheter placed at the apex of the left ventricle and was taken from 3 to 5 end-respiratory cycles if patients could tolerate breath holding. The LVFP value was calculated as the mean of at least 3 consecutive cardiac cycles.\n\nEchocardiographic and myocardial tissue Doppler measurements: Echocardiography was performed immediately after LVFP measurements. All studies were performed by experienced sonographers and the results were reviewed by staff cardiologists with advanced echocardiography training. Left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated using Simpson's method for biplane images. Pulsed-wave tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) was performed using spectral pulsed Doppler signal filters, by adjusting the Nyquist limit to 15 - 20 cm/s (which approximated the myocardial velocities) and using the minimum optimal gain. In the apical views, a 3-mm, a pulsed-wave Doppler sample volume was placed at the level of the mitral annulus over the septal, lateral and inferior borders. Pulsed-wave TDI results were characterized by a myocardial systolic wave (Sm) and 2 diastolic waves: early (Em) and atrial contraction (Am). The pulsed-wave TDI tracing was recorded over 5 cardiac cycles at a sweep speed of 100 mm/s and was used for offline calculations. Average Em of septal and lateral mitral annulus was chose to estimate LVFP by the method of mitral E/Em.\n\nMeasurement of LA volume: All volume measurements were calculated from apical four- and two-chamber views using the biplane area-length method. The LA volumes were measured at three points: 1) immediately before the mitral valve opening (maximal LV volume or Volmax); 2) at onset of the P-wave on electrocardiography (pre-atrial contraction volume or Volp); and 3) at mitral valve closure (minimal LV volume or Volmin). The LA distensibility was calculated as (Volmax - Volmin) / Volmin. The LA ejection fraction was calculated as (Volp - Volmin) / Volp. In all patients, LA volumes were indexed to body surface area (BSA).\n\nFollow-up: During index hospitalization, only cardiovascular death was deemed an event. A follow-up survey assessing inhospital mortality and hard events was carried out after discharge of index hospitalization. Sudden cardiac death, death related to cardiovascular problem, and any hospitalization related to heart were defined as hard event. Death within 1 hour of the onset of acute illness or sudden collapse with unknown cause was diagnosed as sudden cardiac death. Follow-up was performed between December 2007 and February 2010 by telephone interviews, medical record reviews, and home visits.\n\nInterobserver variability: In the first fifty enrolled cases, Volmax, Volmin, and Volp were measured by two independent observers. Interobserver variability was calculated as the difference between the values obtained by the two observers divided by the mean. Interobserver difference and variability of Volmax were 4.1\u00b15.4 ml and 6.6\u00b18.7%, respectively. Interobserver variabilities and differences, were 8.1\u00b18.9% and 2.9\u00b13.2 ml for Volmin, 6.7\u00b17.4% and 3.1\u00b13.4 for Volp, respectively. Therefore, interobserver variabilities in LA distensibility and LA ejection fraction measurements were 7.8\u00b16.6% and 3.1\u00b13.2%, respectively.\n\nStatistical analysis: The SPSS software was used for all statistical analyses. Baseline characteristics of the study patients were grouped according to quartile of LA distensibility. All continuous variables were presented as means \u00b1 standard deviation. Analysis of variance and post hoc test for unpaired data were used to evaluate the significance of differences between groups. A p vale of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Comparison of clinical characteristics was performed by chi-square analysis for categorical variables. Event-free survival curves were generated by means of Kaplan-Meier estimates, and differences in survival were compared with use of the log-rank test. To evaluate the effect of different levels of LA distensibility on in-hospital mortality, and hard events, relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were calculated as hazard ratios derived from the Cox proportional-hazards model. Multivariate models were fitted with use of the available clinical covariates. The relationship curve between LA distensibility and LVFP was estimated using SPSS software. Bivariate analysis, simple correlation and linear regression were used when appropriate. Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was also performed to assess the sensitivity and specificity for predicting elevated LVFP (> 15 mmHg).",
                                            "summary": "Left atrial volume (LAV) provides the significant prognostic information in the general population and patients with heart disease, including acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Large left atrial volume, which represents chronic diastolic dysfunction, is associated with poor outcome, regardless of systolic function. Thereby, LAV provides a long-term view of whether or not the patient has the disease of diastolic dysfunction, regardless of whatever loading conditions are present at the time of the examination, as the hemoglobin A1C in diabetes. However, whether left atrial (LA) parameters could correlate with LVFP and reflect short-term change in left ventricular filling pressure(LVFP) remains unknown. Only one article of our team confirmed the relationship between LAV and LVFP in patients with severe mitral regurgitation by simultaneous echocardiography-catheterization. The prior report proposed a new parameter, LA distensibility, and disclosed its logarithmic relationship with LVFP. The LA distensibility precisely indicated rapid change in LVFP of patients with acute severe mitral regurgitation, and was even superior to mitral E/Em (early-diastolic mitral inflow velocity divided by early-diastolic mitral annular velocity). As left atrial pressure rises to maintain adequate left ventricular diastolic filling, increased atrial wall tension tends to dilate the chamber and stretch the atrial myocardium. Therefore, the smaller left atrial stretchability, the more pressure left atrium (LA) faces to. The first objective of this study was to test the value of LA distensibility for assessing LVFP, particularly in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The second objective was to assess the prognostic value of LA distensibility.",

The method involves scanning the genomes from many different people and looking for genetic markers that can be used to predict the presence of a disease. Once such genetic markers are identified, they can be used to understand how genes contribute to the disease and develop better prevention and treatment strategies.",

The impact of air temperature (changes) or humidity are of potential relevance. In addition, exercise and the associated increase in oxygen demand of the myocardium and blood pressure is another trigger for plaque rupture and the acute onset of myocardial infarction. Male patients as well as patients with previous coronary heart disease or little regular exercise are at increased risk.\n\nPossible additional mechanisms of exercise induced myocardial infarction are vasospasm and changes in blood clotting.\n\nChanges in the ambient temperature (warm to cold) can also induce vasospasm which might result in reduced perfusion and plaque rupture. It seems that male patients are more involved than female patients.\n\nTaking the exercise and the ambient temperature changes into consideration, heavy snowfall with consecutive snow shoveling is an augmented risk for acute myocardial infarction.\n\nThe rationale of the study is to test if the above mentioned constellation of environmental factors as well as potential increased exercise have a significant and independent impact on the incidence of myocardial infarctions",

Approximately 40,000 young women are hospitalized each year in the United States as a result of a heart attack. Research has shown that young women who have heart attacks are twice as likely to die in the hospital as young men who have heart attacks. While there has been an increase in awareness, little research has been conducted on understanding heart disease and heart attacks in young women. Specific biologic markers involved with inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, sex hormones, and genetics may indicate a predisposition to a heart attack and poor recovery. This study will analyze the biologic, demographic, psychosocial, environmental, and behavioral factors that may contribute to premature heart disease and to poor recovery after a heart attack in women. Researchers will examine if delays in receiving medical care following a heart attack can affect recovery and health outcomes for women. Gender differences in outcomes and the quality of medical care that is received following a heart attack will also be examined.\n\nThis study will enroll women and men who are hospitalized following a possible heart attack. At study entry, participants will be interviewed to collect information about symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and medical care. A medical record review will also occur. At 1 month after admission from the hospital, an interview will occur via phone and a blood sample will be collected when the participant returns to the hospital or alternatively be collected at a medical clinic convenient to the participant. Another telephone interview will occur at 12 months. Participants' blood samples will be stored for future biologic and genetic studies.",

However, other studies failed to show this correlation.\n\nWith respect to nitric oxydes the majority of published studies detected a significant correlation with myocardial infarction, too, although a highly ranked publication failed to show the same result. In addition data on the impact of sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide concentration on cardiac events is very heterogeneous.\n\nPublished data indicates additive effects of age and other epidemiological variables suggesting the need of a multivariate analysis.\n\nThe rationale of the study is to test if the above mentioned air pollution factors have a significant and independent impact on the incidence of myocardial infarctions",

France is currently facing the COVID-19 wave with more than 131 863 confirmed cases and almost 25 201 deaths. Systems of care have been reorganized in an effort to preserve hospital bed capacity, resources, and avoid exposure of patients to the hospital environment where COVID-19 may be more prevalent. Therefore, elective procedures of catheterization and programmed hospitalizations have been delayed. However, a significant proportion of procedures within the catheterization laboratory such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina are mandatory and cannot be postponed. Surprisingly, invasive cardiologist noticed a drop in STEMI volume without reliable data to confirm this impression. Furthermore, a recent single center report in Hong Kong pointed out longer delays of taking care when compared to patients with STEMI treated with percutaneous intervention the previous year. These data are at major concern because delay in seeking care or not seeking care could have detrimental impact on outcomes.",

This complication occurs, for 70% of cases, at the patient's residence, within 30 minutes following the thoracic pain. Emergency care often comes too late and allows only 2% of the patients having a heart failure to be revitalized.\n\nAt equal sex, age and clinical status, patients may or not develop ventricular rhythm disorders. Then, the notions of risk background and genetic disposition should be investigated.\n\nNo prospective study has been conducted on a sufficient number of patients yet. Such a study and the recent development of new genetic technologies will help identifying markers of sudden death risk at the acute phase of myocardial infarction.\n\nThe study we are implementing will increase knowledge on sudden death mechanisms at the acute phase of myocardial infarction. The analysis of phenotypic/genotypic relations will lead to an identification of new risk markers. Further evaluations of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies will be possible on the basis of this trial.\n\nVentricular fibrillation at the acute phase of myocardial infarction follows a polygenic determinism. The genes involved in this electrical trouble are those which lead to the expression of potassic, calcic and sodic channels of ventricular myocytes: KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, PRKAG2, RyR2, PKP2, DSP, CASQ2, CACNA1C, and FKBP1B.\n\nAn association of a favourable genetic background and ischemia represents a cause for ventricular arrhythmia as a complication of myocardial infarction.\n\nHaplotypes or genes considered as new markers for sudden death risk of ischemic origin will be searched.",

The second phase will concern the genotype/phenotype analysis and the identification of polymorphisms associated with a sudden death risk after a myocardial infarction.\n\nThis study will allow a better knowledge of the mechanisms of sudden death and the identification of new risk markers.",

The optimum time to perform this scan, the method of data analysis and it's effectiveness as a predictor of future cardiac events has not been adequately assessed.\n\nThis trial will assess the amount and natural time-course of oedema in the first 10 days following a heart attack. It will also correlate the amount of oedema with the size of scar (damaged heart muscle) and left ventricular ejection fraction (heart function) at 3 months to assess if it is a predictive marker.",

Indeed, PPCI is associated with a rapid restore of coronary flow and with a better outcome compared to pharmacological therapy. However in a sizable proportion of patients PPCI achieves only epicardial coronary artery reperfusion but not myocardial reperfusion, a condition known as no-reflow. A series of consistent data has clearly shown that no-reflow has a strong negative impact on outcome, negating the potential benefit of PPCI. No-reflow may be caused by the variable combination of 4 pathogenetic components: 1) distal atherothrombotic embolization; 2) ischemic injury; 3) reperfusion injury; and 4) susceptibility of coronary microcirculation to injury. In particular during PPCI emboli of different sizes can originate from fissurated atherosclerotic plaques and occlude the microvascular bed. Several pharmacological, mechanical or technical strategies have been proposed for the prevention and treatment of distal embolization and coronary no-reflow with variable results, but there are no data addressing the possible effect of different stent designs on the distal embolization of thrombotic fragments.\n\nCoronary stents can be divided in open cell or closed cell stents according to their design. Typically, the number and arrangement of bridge connectors differentiate open-cell from closed-cell designs. If adjacent ring segments are connected at every possible junction, the design is classified as closed cell. If some or all of the connecting junction points are removed, the design is classified as open cell. Such a design inherently allows for more flexion between adjacent rings, because fewer connection points allow for greater flexion and conformability. The flexion benefits of an open-cell design have a cost in scaffolding uniformity, just as the scaffolding benefits of a closed-cell design have a cost in flexion and conformability. A previous study, performed in patients who underwent carotid stenting, showed a significant reduction in distal embolization associated with the use of closed cell stents compared to open cell stents. However there are no study comparing the open or closed stent design during percutaneous coronary intervention particularly in condition at high risk of embolization as acute myocardial infarction.\n\nSTUDY HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to determine whether a closed cell stent design may reduce distal embolization and no reflow during PPCI for acute STEMI compared to an open cell stent design. The study population will include all consecutive patients admitted in our hospital for acute STEMI and treated with PPCI within 12 hours from symptom onset.\n\nMETHODS Design This study will be a prospective, randomized trial.\n\nPatient selection Eligibility criteria: patients with an age > 18 years with acute STEMI treated with PPCI within 12 hours from symptom onset and who agree and provide written informed consent. STEMI is defined as chest pain associated with ST-elevation of 1 mm or more in two or more contiguous leads or new left bundle-branch block within 12 hours after the onset of chest pain.\n\nExclusion criteria will be: implanted stent with diameter < 2.5 mm, cardiogenic shock, time from pain onset to PPCI >12 hours, previous thrombolytic therapy (rescue PPCI), inability to provide informed consent.\n\nSubjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria may be enrolled into the study.\n\nInterventional procedure All patients enrolled in this randomized study should be treated according to the standard of care of our centre and according to guidelines.\n\nPharmacological treatment. At admission and before the procedure all patients will be treated with 500 mg of chewable aspirin, with 600 mg of clopidogrel and with 5000 U of unfractionated heparin i.v. Additional intravenous heparin will be administered during the procedure to maintain an activated clotting time of 200-250 seconds with the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or 250-300 seconds without the administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. The administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (preferably intracoronary abciximab) will be left to the operator's discretion but is significantly encouraged. At the end of the procedure and before the final angiography a dose of 1 \u00b5g of nitrate i.c. will be administrated.\n\nAfter the procedure in all cases heparin administration will be interrupted and patients will be treated with low dose of aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day).\n\nProcedure. Direct stenting is encouraged, but the use of predilation is left to operator's discretion. The use of manual thrombectomy before stenting or predilation is mandatory in case of Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow \u22641 or high thrombus burden after crossing the lesion with the wire. In all cases an effort should be made to use a single stent whenever possible. All stent will be deployed at 14 atmosphere for 30 seconds and then in all cases an angiography will be performed. Post-dilatation with over expansion of the stent is discouraged but it is allowed in cases of sub-optimal angiographic results.\n\nStent. Two different stent design will be employed: a closed cell stent (Presillion Plus\u2122, Cordis) and two open cell stents (Driver\u2122 or Integrity\u2122, Medtronic).\n\nRandomization. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the closed cell stent or the open stent cell. Allocation to one of the two stent will be made by means of sealed envelopes containing a concealed computer-generated random sequence which was set in blocks of 20.\n\nIn-hospital assessment and clinical follow-up Laboratory tests: patients will undergo pre-procedural, 12, 24 and 48 hours blood draws to measure creatine kinase (CK), CK-myocardial band (CK-MB) mass, and troponin T as routinely scheduled for all patients in our centre.\n\nElectrocardiogram: A 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be recorded before and after the procedure to evaluate the ST resolution\n\nEND-POINTS Primary end-point: the primary end-point will be the corrected TIMI frame count at the end of the procedure defined as the number of frames required to opacify standardized angiographic landmarks and normalized for vessel length and a composite angiographic and electrocardiographic end-point including angiographic events such as distal embolization, slow-flow (decrease in flow from TIMI 3 to TIMI 2) or no-reflow (decrease in flow from TIMI 2 or 3 to TIMI 0 or 1) and a binary ECG criterion of microvascular reperfusion injury as defined by the presence of persistent (>50% of initial value) ST-segment elevation 30 to 60 min after completion of the procedure as previously described.\n\nSecondary end-points: Secondary end-points will be: the corrected TIMI frame count after stent deployment; a composite angiographic end-point including angiographic events such as distal embolization, slow-flow (decrease in flow from TIMI 3 to TIMI 2) or no-reflow (decrease in flow from TIMI 2 or 3 to TIMI 0 or 1) after stent deployment; the infarct size detect by myocardial enzyme release.\n\nTertiary end-points: in hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, reinfarction, target lesion revascularization)",

The pattern of myocardial injury and its functional consequence will be evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.

This differentiates between myocardial infarction due to plaque rupture (type 1) and myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance (type 2) in other acute illnesses. However, these guidelines have not been widely adopted as the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction are not clearly defined. Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction have poor long term outcomes, with at least twice the mortality at five years compared to those with an index type 1 myocardial infarction. Despite the majority of deaths being attributable to non-cardiovascular events, the rate of future type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death is similar regardless of index classification. If this future risk is related to the presence of underlying coronary artery disease, then there may be the potential to improve outcomes through targeted investigation and secondary prevention. The investigators will undertake a systematic evaluation of the mechanism of myocardial injury and the role of coronary artery disease in 100 patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations where the diagnosis is likely to be type 2 myocardial infarction. These studies will help improve the assessment of patients with myocardial injury, refine the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction, and aid the design of future therapeutic trials.",

The MRI scan will consist of localisers, axial and coronal HASTE images, standard breath-held and ECG-gated cine sequences. Short-axis cine images will be obtained for the assessment of left ventricle function and volumes. Left ventricle volumes, mass and ejection fraction will be assessed using dedicated software and values indexed to body surface area. Breath-held, ECG-gated T2 mapping sequences of the myocardium will be performed in the short-axis as a marker of myocardial inflammation. T1-weighted imaging of the coronary arteries will be performed to look for evidence of recent intraplaque thrombus or haemorrhage. The late gadolinium enhancement and T2 mapping techniques will identify regions of new or old myocardial infarction as well as other patterns of injury. Where there are no contraindications, stress MRI will be performed using intravenous Regadenoson.",

This is especially so in developing countries such as Mauritius in which optimal therapy for acute myocardial infarction may not be widely available. For example for patients presenting with a heart attack (caused by a blockage in one of the heart blood vessels) the treatment of choice would be to remove the blockage by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using an angioplasty balloon and put a stent (a spring-like structure) to keep the artery opened. However, PCI is not widely available in Mauritius and heart attack patients are given clot-busting therapy to remove the blockage, but this is not as effective as PCI.\n\nTherefore, in this research study we investigate a new cheap treatment that may help protect the heart against damage during a heart attack, called remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), in which a blood pressure cuff is placed on the upper arm and inflated for 5 minute and deflated for 5 minutes a cycle which is repeated 4 times in total in patients presenting with a heart attack. By temporarily depriving oxygen and nutrients to the arm with the blood pressure cuff a protective signal can be relayed to the heart to reduce the amount of damage occurring during the heart attack and thereby prevent the onset of heart failure.\n\nStudy hypothesis: Remote ischaemic conditioning will reduce the amount of damage occurring to the heart muscle during a heart attack..",

When compared to bare metal stents, sirolimus-eluting stents were associated with less restenosis and target vessel revascularization (TVR) up until one year of follow-up. , At present, it is unclear whether this also holds for paclitaxel-eluting stents.4,\n\nEverolimus is a sirolimus analogue, an effective anti-proliferative agent that inhibits growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest in the late G1 stage in the cell cycle.\n\nThe objective of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System versus a modified cobalt chromium balloon expandable stent in the setting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention for treatment of patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.\n\nThis study is a prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, two-arm, multi center clinical evaluation.

Cardiac troponin is considered to be a cornerstone in the diagnosis of a myocardial infarction. Heart-type Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (H-FABP) is a new sensitive biomarker for myocardial injury. The effectiveness of using the combination of H-FABP with Troponin to diagnose myocardial injury within 6 hours after the onset of ischemia is well reported. Previous studies in non-surgical patients have associated increased H-FABP with an increased risk of subsequent death and major cardiac events. The prognostic value in cardiac surgery patients has not been studied extensively.\n\nThe objective is to estimate the association between biomarkers of myocardial injury and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Myocardial infarction will be established with both a new and very early marker of myocardial injury (Heart-type Fatty Acid Binding Proteins) as well as to a known early marker of such injury (Cardiac troponin).",

In the US, approximately 6 million people annually undergo evaluation in the ED for acute chest pain. Despite the wealth of knowledge available about acute coronary syndrome (ACS), this condition continues to be among the most difficult to predict or diagnose. Misdiagnoses may lead to discharge of patients with ACS, who should have been admitted as well as costly unnecessary hospitalizations of patients who do not have ACS.\n\nMore than 2/3 of the patients with ACS have unstable angina (UA) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Conventional ECG has low sensitivity of less than 50% in diagnosing these conditions. As the initial ECG in the ED is often non-diagnostic in ACS patients, the diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during its early stages may also be difficult.\n\nAnalysis of high-frequency QRS components (HFQRS), which quantifies changes in the depolarization phase of the cardiac cycle, has been previously reported to be a sensitive method for detection of demand ischemia. Preliminary studies have shown that HFQRS-derived indices can also identify supply ischemia caused by prolonged balloon occlusion, and transient ischemic episodes in patients with chest pain.",

The majority of patients do not have a heart attack (myocardial infarction), and may be safely discharged from the Emergency Department.\n\nThe investigators propose to evaluate whether the use of the HighSTEACS pathway in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome reduces length of stay and allows more patients to be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. This pathways utilizes high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I testing and will rule out myocardial infarction if troponin concentrations are <5 ng/L on presentation, with further testing indicated at 3 hours only in those presenting early or with troponin concentrations between 5 ng/L and the 99th centile.\n\nIn six secondary and tertiary centres across Scotland, the investigators will introduce the pathway as part of a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. Sequential hypothesis testing will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the pathway. The primary efficacy end-point will be length of stay from time of presentation until final hospital discharge and the primary safety end-point will be survival free from type 1 or 4b myocardial infarction or cardiac death from discharge to 30 days. The study population will consist of those patients with cardiac troponin concentrations within the normal reference range (<99th centile) at presentation.",

The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref 09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).\n\nThe use of antipsychotics is associated with a rise in cardiovascular events. Previous studies investigating the effect of antipsychotic agents on the risk of Myocardial Infarction (MI) led to conflicting results with reports of either no association or a positive association. As patient populations for whom antipsychotic agents are indicated differ considerably from healthy comparison populations, confounding by indication could be substantial. Whilst confounding can be accounted for if known and measured, residual confounding remains a potential problem. This study aims to assess the relationship between the risk of MI and recent exposure to antipsychotic agents by using the self-controlled case series method with which we are able to control for fixed confounders. The results of the self-controlled case series method will be compared to the results of a case-control study using the same data to explore the role of confounding by indication.",
                                            "summary": "A number of studies have suggested an association between the use of antipsychotic agents and cardiovascular mortality. However, the relationship between cardiac events and the use of antipsychotic drugs is not clear. Patients experiencing psychoses and in need for antipsychotic agents may be at a higher risk of cardiac events regardless of any effect of antipsychotic medication. Two studies have specifically investigated the association between the use of antipsychotics and the risk of cardiac events using Myocardial Infarction (MI) as an outcome measure, reporting no association and a positive association respectively. This difference in results may be explained by the use of different measures as well as study designs in both studies and because of different limitations with regard to controlling for lifestyle and medical risk factors. This study aims to assess the relationship between the risk of MI and recent exposure to antipsychotic agents by using the self-controlled case series method with which we are able to control for fixed confounders. The results of the self-controlled case series method will be compared to the results of a case-control study using the same data to compare the estimates of both methods.",

Objective: To evaluate the safety of the 6MWT performed on the third day after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: It's a cross-sectional study, to be accomplished in Hospital S\u00e3o Paulo - Federal University of Sao Paulo. Individuals, of both genders, aged 18 years and over, will be assessed on the third day after acute myocardial infarction. The 6MWT will be performed according to the norms of the American Thoracic Society. The distance covered during the 6MWT will be measured as weel as adverse events.",

However, as many as 50% of CAD patients lack classical risk factors of CAD suggesting the presence of other contributory mechanisms. Inflammation plays a central role in the initiation and growth of the plaques which form in the arteries (atherosclerosis) and lead to CAD3. As such periodontal disease, an inflammatory process leading to progressive destruction of tooth-supporting structures, has been associated with CAD. In vivo pre-clinical studies have shown that bacteria associated with periodontal disease can exacerbate atherosclerosis 7. Numerous clinical studies have explored the association between periodontal disease and CAD at different follow-up times following episodes of myocardial infarction 8-9. However, there are no reports investigating this association during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. In addition the need for rigorous matching of all known CAD risk factors in case control studies has so far been overseen.\n\nRATIONALE FOR STUDY:\n\nThis case-control study aims to compare the health of tooth supporting structures (periodontium) in patients hospitalised for acute myocardial infarction to a control group of patients rigorously matched for known CAD risk factors, age and gender.",
                                            "summary": "Heart attack remains a major cause of death in adult population worldwide and especially within Scotland. A large portion of the general population has an increased risk of suffering from a heart attack because of their genetic make-up, disease profile and lifestyle choices.\n\nLiterature suggests that apart from these known risk factors, long-standing inflammation (reaction of tissues to infection or injury) elsewhere in the body may be responsible for heart attacks. It has been suggested that gum disease may be one such condition. If left untreated, gum disease may expose the entire body to a long-term inflammatory burden where inflammatory molecules can disseminate from the gums into the bloodstream and affect various body structures. This study explores the influence of gum disease on the risk of heart attack by comparing the gum health of participants who recently had a heart attack to the gum health of participants with no history of heart problems after accounting for other risk factors. Findings will provide critical information for the design of our forthcoming study to establish the effect of treatment of gum disease on the risk of heart attack, and its cost-effectiveness. Ultimately this research will tackle another risk factor for heart attacks and thus inform enhancement of public health prevention strategies.",

And about 10% of all emergency department consultations are with symptoms suggestive of AMI, however, only 10% to 20% of them are diagnosed as experiencing an AMI. Rapid and accurate identification of AMI is of paramount clinical importance for subsequent timely and effectively treatment and management.\n\nRecently, the investigators identified microarray analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from AMI animal models and small samples of AMI patients, a molecular signature of AMI involving 5 circRNAs (circRNA_006877, circRNA_015350, circRNA_002969, circRNA_013240, circRNA_004682) was found significantly change in AMI patients and likely serves as candidate serum biomarkers of AMI. Among the 5 circRNAs, circRNA_006877 name of circRNA-Uck2 (cUck2) has more close association with AMI.\n\nTYPE OF STUDY : multicenter diagnostic evaluation Study MAIN PURPOSE OF THE STUDY : To evaluate the diagnostic value of circRNAs in AMI in adults as compared to healthy and unstable angina controls\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES :\n\nassess the ability of cUck2 to discriminate a AMI disease from unstable angina patients in adults.\n\nexplore the relationship between cUck2 and heart function after myocardial infarction PRODUCTS OF THE STUDY diagnostic kit of AMI in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) NUMBER OF PATIENTS : 3 groups with 169 patients will be included Group 1: 66 AMI adult patients Group 2: 56 unstable angina adults Group 3: 56 Witnesses healthy adults INCLUSION LENGTH 36 months DURATION OF THE STUDY 42 months",

At the time of discharge from the coronary care unit, clinical data will be entered. The registry will include approximately 6800 patients.\n\nAs there is no intervention in the registry, the data to be collected are standard for quality assurance purposes and cannot practicably be carried out without waivers of consent and HIPAA authorization, there will be no consent specifically for registry patients at baseline. Systems have been implemented to ensure the registry data will remain confidential. Sites have received IRB approval of waiver of consent and HIPAA for the baseline registry data.\n\nData to be collected will include demographic (including ethnic and race classifications according to NIH guidelines) data and information regarding the index myocardial infarction. Use of beta-blockers at discharge from the coronary care unit will be documented. In addition, beta-blocker use at hospital discharge will be noted. Data for the registry will be obtained from ER notes, admission notes, cardiac catheterization lab reports, medication lists, lab reports, and discharge summaries.\n\nFollow-Up\n\nFollow-up for registry patients will be conducted at year 1 and year 2 post-myocardial infarction. Data may be obtained via medical chart review, phone contact, and Social Security Death Index (SSDI). For follow-up information obtained via chart review or the SSDI, a detailed justification for waiver of HIPAA and consent requirements is attached to this protocol (see appendix 7). If phone contact is required with the patient, we are suggesting the following process:\n\nA letter should be sent out to the patient approximately one week prior to the contact in which the rationale for the study will be provided, as well as a delineation of the patient's right to participate or not to participate (by either providing or not providing the requested information).\nAt telephone contact with the patient, the coordinator will document whether the patient consents to provide the information. If the patient consents, the coordinator will proceed to obtain the requested information.\nIn the event that the participating institution's IRB requires a written, signed consent for this verbal contact, a written consent form template (see appendix 3) is provided.\n\nData collected at follow-up interview will include vital status, beta-blocker use, other cardiac medications and any cardiovascular hospitalizations.",

During the MI hospitalization, questionnaires will be administered to assess psychosocial stress leading up to the event (MI). Participants will also have the option to enroll in the HARP-Stress Ancillary Study and HARP-Platelet Sub-Study. Two months following MI, participants may be screened for the Stress Ancillary Study. Women with elevated perceived stress at screening will be enrolled. Patients will complete baseline assessments (self-report questionnaires and 7 days of wrist actigraphy) and then will be randomized to group-based stress management or to enhanced usual care (EUC). Both study arms involve 8 weekly phone sessions delivered by trained facilitators. Following intervention, participants in both study arms will repeat self-report questionnaires and 7 days of wrist actigraphy. Anticipate enrollment of approximately 200 women to meet target of 144 qualified women.",

The risk of recurrent cardiovascular events may be related to persistent elevation of thrombin beyond the index event 2,3\n\nwhich leads to progression of cardiovascular disease by inducing inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis 4. In patients with coronary heart disease, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been explored as secondary prevention strategies and have shown cardiovascular benefits at the cost of higher bleeding events 5,6,7,8.\n\nhoweverLeft ventricular thrombus (LVT) usually appearswithin 1 month after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and mostlyforms after anterior STEMI.9,11Although the prevalenceof LVT after acute myocardial infarction hasdecreased dramatically in modern times due to the progress of reperfusion therapy, LVT incidence in patients with anterior STEMI remains at 4% to 26%.10,12 It complicates acute myocardial infarction and is associated with a higher incidence of poor outcomes.9",

The basic premise is that AMI leads to systemic inflammation that includes inflammation in the brain. The PET tracer [18F]DPA-714 binds to the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO, also known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) in the mitochondria of activated microglia/macrophages and provides a non-invasive measure of neuroinflammation. The estimates of brain TSPO binding in patients with recent AMI will be compared to a matched group of patients who have undergone a recent elective PCI procedure.",

Beginning first with thrombolytic therapy for AMI, and more recently with growing acceptance and availability of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation AMI, the mortality rates of this devastating ischemic event have decreased from almost 15% in clinical trials in the late 1980's to <5% in recent primary percutaneous coronary intervention trials. Though AMI-related mortality has been reduced, AMI survival is often accompanied by significant loss of function that may lead to subsequent treatments, congestive heart failure (CHF) and reduction in quality of life. A cell therapy that could reduce the damage associated with AMI and positively affect heart function would provide substantial benefits to the AMI patient.",

We hypothesize that patients treated with stem cell therapy will have beneficial effects on left ventricular (LV) remodeling and functional regeneration after MI and successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in setting of prospective randomized controlled trial.\n\nCongestive heart failure (CHF), which is most commonly caused by acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is the most frequent cause of hospitalization in the United States in patients over the age of 65. Although current pharmacotherapy can inhibit neurohormonal activation, this falls short in preventing LV remodeling and the development of CHF. Stem cells are undifferentiated pluripotent cells that can be obtained from the patient and have the potential to proliferate and differentiation into cardiomyocytes. The majority of the data on stem cell transplantation comes from preclinical animal studies. Although the results are interesting and perhaps safe, early phase I clinical studies are small and are very preliminary. Data from large, randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the short and long term effects of cellular cardiomyoplasty.",

However, up to 25-50% of patients who have angioplasty may have ongoing damage to the heart muscle when the blockage is opened and blood flow is restored. Complications which may result from this ongoing damage include a larger area of damaged muscle in the heart, enlargement of the heart, an increased risk of death, and an increased risk of heart failure. Some of the ongoing damage may involve increased levels of the protein kinase C (PKC) enzyme. KAI-9803 is a selective inhibitor of delta PKC. In this study, delta PKC is used with angioplasty and other standard procedures to restore blood flow after a heart attack. This study is designed to evaluate safety of different amounts of KAI-9803 when used in treating heart attack patients undergoing angioplasty. We will also try to evaluate whether KAI-9803 can reduce the amount of heart muscle damage and the complications that may occur in these patients.",

The heart muscle may weaken, causing heart failure. The body naturally makes a protein called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that may protect the heart muscle cells from dying and may prevent heart failure or lessen the damage that occurs. IGF-1 is also available as a drug called mecasermin. In this study, heart attack patients will be given either a dose of mecasermin or a placebo (inactive treatment) after their coronary artery has been opened by a stent. The purpose of the study will be to evaluate the safety of the therapy and to test if the therapy will prevent or lessen heart failure by evaluating a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken one day and eight weeks after the heart attack.",

Efficacy will be assessed by measurements of both the angiographic characteristics of the culprit lesion as well as by measurements of epicardial flow and myocardial perfusion in the territory of the infarct-related artery. This study will also evaluate the safety of administering low-dose IC tenecteplase to subjects undergoing primary PCI for STEMI treated with standard therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors). Safety endpoints include the incidence of death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), abrupt vessel closure, subacute stent thrombosis, and TIMI major and minor bleeding events.\n\nPrompt reperfusion therapy with primary PCI in patients with STEMI improves clinical outcomes through salvage of myocardial tissue. The proposed pilot trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive low-dose IC tenecteplase in conjunction with standard medical therapy during primary PCI for STEMI. We hypothesized that low-dose IC tenecteplase will enhance fibrinolysis at the site of the culprit lesion leading to reduced microvascular dysfunction. As reduced dose tenecteplase will be injected directly into the coronary artery increasing local concentration of the drug with minor systemic effects, an improved safety profile is also expected from this mode of administration.",

However, up to 25-50% of patients who have angioplasty may have ongoing damage to the heart muscle when the blockage is opened and blood flow is restored. Complications which may result from this ongoing damage include a larger area of damaged muscle in the heart, enlargement of the heart, an increased risk of death, and an increased risk of heart failure. Some of the ongoing damage may involve increased levels of the protein kinase C (PKC) enzyme. KAI-9803 is a selective inhibitor of delta PKC. In this study, delta PKC is used with angioplasty and other standard procedures to restore blood flow after a heart attack. This study is designed to evaluate safety of different amounts of KAI-9803 when used in treating heart attack patients undergoing angioplasty. We will also try to evaluate whether KAI-9803 can reduce the amount of heart muscle damage and the complications that may occur in these patients.",

Current management strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect: ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out. The investigators therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of intracoronary autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived human MSCs in patients with AMI.",

The heart muscle may weaken, causing heart failure. The body naturally makes a protein called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that may protect the heart muscle cells from dying and may prevent heart failure or lessen the damage that occurs. IGF-1 is also available as a drug called mecasermin. In this study, heart attack patients will be given either a dose of mecasermin or a placebo (inactive treatment) after their coronary artery has been opened by a stent. The purpose of the study will be to evaluate the safety of the therapy and to test if the therapy will prevent or lessen heart failure by evaluating a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken one day and eight weeks after the heart attack.",

In this trial the null hypothesis is that there is no effect of EPO on myocardial infarct size, the alternative hypothesis is that EPO reduces myocardial infarct size.\n\n124 subjects with acute ST-elevation MI who fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria and give informed consent to participate in the study will be recruited from patients referred to the cardiac catheterisation laboratories at the Hammersmith Hospital and King's College Hospital. Subjects will undergo primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty (primary PCI) according to standard clinical protocols. Subjects will be randomised to either placebo or EPO at the time of primary PCI. EPO will be given as a bolus of 12ml containing 33,000U over 30 mins via a peripheral vein followed by an infusion of 24ml containing 67,000 U over 12 hours. Placebo will be identical to EPO without the active ingredient. After the PCI subjects will receive standard care on the coronary care unit. An additional 20ml of blood will be taken each day at the time of routine clinical venesection for storage and subjects will have gadolinium enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) performed before discharge to evaluate infarct size. Follow-up will be performed at 30 days (clinical, ECG and 20ml blood sample) and at 90 days (clinical, ECG and CMR scan and blood sample). The study will end at 90 days and patients will continue with standard clinical care under the direction of a consultant cardiologist.\n\nCMR will be performed in the Robert Steiner MR Unit/Imaging Department, Hammersmith Hospital using a 1.5 tesla scanner according to standard protocols. Each scan will last about 1h and information will be collected on tissue characteristics, left ventricular function, wall motion abnormalities, myocardial perfusion. Myocardial infarcts will be detected by late contrast gadolinium enhancement. Gadolinium will be used at doses up to 0.2mmol/kg and is safe with an incidence of mild and transient side effects including headache and nausea of ~1%. Scans will be performed with under continuous ECG monitoring with a doctor and at least 1 other person present. Resuscitation facilities will be available at all times and the MRI facility is covered by an experienced 24 hour a day cardiac arrest team.",

Recent studies in animals have shown that EPO has protective effects when organs such as the heart and brain are injured by lack of oxygen due to reduced blood supply.\n\nWe wish to test the idea that giving a patient, who is having a heart attack, an injection of EPO will reduce the size of the heart attack.",

A brief synopsis of the AMIHOT experience is provided below, followed by a description of the AMIHOT II study.\n\nThe pivotal AMIHOT clinical study for the TherOx\u00ae Aqueous Oxygen (AO) System in treating post acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients was approved by FDA on January 10, 2002 under IDE G980257/S011. The study objective was to determine whether the adjunctive administration of AO Therapy immediately after successful PCI in a group of patients presenting less than 24 hours from AMI symptom onset improves left ventricular function and reduces the area of infarction, with no increased incidence of 30-day Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) when compared to a control group receiving only PCI standard-of-care treatment. 30-day MACE comprises the combined incidence of death, reinfarction, target vessel revascularization, and stroke.\n\nTwo hundred eighty-nine (289) patients were enrolled from January 16, 2002 through December 24, 2003, including 20 run-in subjects and 269 randomized patients. Three independent biomarkers (infarct size reduction, regional wall motion score improvement at three months, and reduction in ST segment elevation) were designated as co-primary endpoints to evaluate the effectiveness of AO Therapy. The study was designed to demonstrate superiority of the AO Therapy group as compared to controls for each of these endpoints, and to demonstrate non-inferiority of the AO Therapy group as compared to Control with respect to 30-day MACE. The study population was comprised of qualifying AMI patients treated with either PCI alone or with AO Therapy as an adjunct to successful PCI within 24 hours of symptom onset.\n\nThe observed 30-day MACE rates were comparable between the AO Therapy and Control groups. The AMIHOT trial results revealed positive trends for the overall study population in favor of the AO Therapy test group in each of the three co-primary endpoints. These favorable results did not demonstrate the required level of statistical significance to claim superiority. However, an examination of a pre-specified patient subset, anterior AMI subjects treated within six hours of symptom onset, showed promising results after analysis of the surrogate endpoint data, forming the basis for this IDE supplement that requests approval to conduct a new trial focused on this further defined patient population.\n\nTherOx has designed a follow-up clinical trial focused on these anterior AMI subjects treated within six hours, utilizing a Bayesian statistical design that incorporates both the existing AMIHOT data, and the new proposed AMIHOT II study data, into a hierarchical model for combined analysis.\n\nThe key differences between the proposed AMIHOT II study and the previously conducted AMIHOT trial are:\n\nFocused target patient population - anterior AMI subjects revascularized within six hours of symptom onset. (AMIHOT included patients revascularized within 24 hours of symptom onset, irrespective of location of infarct.)\nSingle effectiveness endpoint - infarct size reduction as measured by 14-day Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT imaging. (AMIHOT included 3 co-primary endpoints)\nNon-inferiority comparison of 30-day MACE rates within a 6% safety delta (AMIHOT proposed an 8% delta.)\nRandomization scheme - AMIHOT II will be randomized on a 2.8:1 (AO Therapy Group: Control Group) basis, as compared to the (1:1) randomization used in AMIHOT.\n\nThe method of administration of AO Therapy and the basic design of the AO System and AO Cartridge have not changed since the approval was granted by FDA to conduct the AMIHOT trial. The IDE number for the AMIHOT II clinical proposal is consistent with AMIHOT (G980257).",

Immediate unblocking of the obstructed heart vessel with a balloon catheter and implantation of a mesh scaffold (stent) in heart centers is warranted in these patients. Morbidity and mortality in this patient group is related to the infarct size. Therefore, there is a need to discover novel therapeutic agents which reduce myocardial infarct size and preserve the contractile heart function.\n\nLarge trials involving several thousand patients have demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with impaired heart function due to a heart attack, who received a mineralo-corticoid receptor antagonist (MRA, drug name: spironolactone). In these trials patients received the drug late, 3-14 days after the heart attack.\n\nOur proposal is to investigate whether MRA therapy administered intravenously prior to unblocking an occluded heart vessel, can reduce infarct size and as such can prevent long term sequelae of heart attacks.\n\n150 patients admitted to 4 tertiary care hospitals (Heart Hospital London, London Chest, Essex Cardiothoracic Center and Leeds General Infirmary) for heart attack will be randomly assigned to receive MRA treatment or placebo. The first dose of the MRA will be applied intravenously immediately in the catheter suite, even before re-opening of the occluded vessel. From the second day on, patients will be prescribed oral MRA treatment, as a pill, for a total of three months. Before hospital discharge and after three months, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the heart will accurately investigate the evolution of infarct (scar) size and the contractile heart function and compare the group of patients who received the MRA drug versus the placebo control group. Of note, patients with an ejection fraction <40% AND signs of heart failure OR diabetes will go on open label eplerenone according to current guidelines, instead of the study drug.\n\nThis study will give first evidence, if very early MRA treatment improves heart function and should be used as early as possible for treatment of patients after a heart attack.",

Following randomisation a strategy of early tenecteplase and additional antiplatelet and antithrombin therapy followed by catheterisation within 6-24 hours with timely coronary intervention as appropriate (or by rescue coronary intervention if required) in Group A will be compared to primary PCI performed according to local standards in Group B.\n\nThe study is exploratory in nature and will examine this medical question. The efficacy and safety endpoints as well as mixed (efficacy and safety) composite endpoints up to or before 30 days following randomisation will be evaluated.\n\nAll clinical endpoints of main interest will be assessed as single or composite endpoints for evaluation of the trial objective. All statistical tests are of exploratory nature based on descriptive p-values for formal statistical hypotheses generation.",

The second strategy is identical medical (drug) therapy as the first group combined with early heart catheterization (within 24 hours) for angiography and if required, intervention. The third treatment strategy is direct admission (within 3 hrs) to the heart catheterization lab for angioplasty.\n\nWEST patients will be enrolled at first medical contact (using emergency medical services, e.g. ambulance) if possible or through Emergency Departments in participating health care facilities.",

It has been shown that the reperfusion therapy significantly improves the clinical outcome. Currently the optimal strategy is the primary angioplasty with stent implantation. The treatment is recommended by AHA/ACC and ESC if can be performed within 90 minutes from the first medical contact. However there is still a certain percentage of procedure failure. To further improve the outcome new techniques and devices are tested . Aspiration thrombectomy may facilitate the reperfusion by reducing thrombus burden. The aim of the study is to assess if adjunctive thrombectomy may improve clinical outcome in patients with an acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.",

Current management strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect: ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out. The investigators therefore assessed the safety and efficacy of intracoronary autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived human MSCs in patients with AMI.",

This medical research study will also help determine if the combination of abciximab and reduced dose reteplase will decrease the risk of death, and reduce complications of a heart attack at 90 days compared to abciximab alone which is a standard treatment.\n\nPatients will receive either abciximab and reteplease or abciximab alone. Safety evaluations will be performed at specified intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and the occurrence and severity of adverse events as well as other study specific procedures. Patients will receive either abciximab and reteplease or abciximab and placebo into a vein in their arm for up to 12 hours.",

In order to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, current major guidelines recommend that oral treatment of \u03b2-blockers should be continued during and after hospitalization in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and without contraindications to \u03b2-blocker use.\n\nA clinically important but difficult decision on \u03b2-blocker therapy after AMI is to determine the duration of \u03b2-blocker therapy after discharge in patients without heart failure (HF) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Previous studies for long-term \u03b2-blocker therapy after AMI were inadequate to derive definite conclusion because of small sample size and potential selection bias.\n\nTherefore, the SMART-DECISION trial will investigate whether discontinuation of \u03b2-blocker after at least 1 year of \u03b2-blocker therapy is noninferior to continuation of \u03b2-blocker in patients without HF or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after AMI.",

In fact, the intensity of the inflammatory upregulation is strongly related to the incidence of recurrent coronary events. The investigators previously demonstrated that high dose potent statins can rapidly reduce plasma levels of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins and inflammatory activity in subjects during ACS. In addition, such statin treatment attenuates the post-discharge endothelial dysfunction of these patients. By inference, it is plausible to hypothesize that these beneficial effects during ACS may be intensified by an additive lowering of plasma cholesterol through the treatment with ezetimibe. So far, data is unavailable to verify this assumption. In parallel, data from animal models have suggested that both statins and ezetimibe may reduce insulin sensitivity by their effect on cholesterol content and, by this way, on insulin signaling in liver cells. In this context, the present study aims to investigate the role of the addition of ezetimibe upon statin treatment on stress-induced insulin resistance and on the time-course of the inflammatory response during the acute phase of myocardial infarction and its late effect on endothelium-dependent arterial dilation.",

Even if patients with AMI survive the acute period without death, some ones would inevitably develop into chronic heart failure due to myocardial ischemia caused by segmental ventricular wall dyskinesia, myocardial remodeling, etc., which would seriously affect the prognosis of these patients. Early intensive treatment is the decisive factor to reduce the death of patients with AMI. However, the primary hospitals where patients firstly visit do not have the ability of Primary Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Intervention (PCI) the guidelines recommend. They have to transport patients to a center that has the conditions for emergency interventional treatment. But this transportation will delay a lot of time, resulting in the extension of MI area. More importantly, the thrombus load in coronary arteries would increase with time, and the implantation of stents in vessels with a large thrombus load will often lead to slow flow or no flow, which is a relative contraindication for interventional therapy.\n\nAt present, the guidelines recommend loading dose antiplatelet therapy and transport to the superior hospital for prime PCI within 2 hours if the first hospital for acute myocardial infarction does not have the conditions for emergency interventional therapy. Current guidelines recommend that thrombolytic therapy should be performed first and then transported when delivery is expected to be >2 hours to a hospital where PCI can be performed. And thrombolytic therapy is not recommended for patients who can perform PCI within <2 hours. There is a lack of clinical evidence for thrombolysis within 2 hours of first medical contact to Primary PCI. Compared with Primary PCI, early thrombolytic therapy can undoubtedly shorten the implementation time of reperfusion strategy to the maximum. For highly effective thrombolytic drugs, reperfusion time should be shortened, thrombus load should be reduced, and the size of myocardial infarction may be reduced and the prognosis of patients improved. There is a lack of clinical evidence for this. China is a developing country, whose grassroots and rural health resources are still poor. Early thrombolysis treatment plus subsequent reperfusion of interventional therapy not only conform to the Chinese characteristic, but also accord with the international research and the development direction in this field, which is worth further study.\n\nStaphylokinase (SAK) is produced by Staphylococcus aureus and it is a protein containing 136 amino acid residues. Its ability for dissolving blood clots was first discovered in 1948. Studies have shown that SAK is not directly convert plasminogen (PLG) into plasminogen (PLi), but first combines with PLG in a 1:1 ratio to form a complex. The complex can lead to the exposure of PLG active site, from single chain to double chain PLi, resulting to form an active SAK-PLI complex, which subsequently activates PLG molecules. Then PLG transforms into PLi and further dissolve the thrombus.\n\nRecombinant SAK (r-SAK) was developed in 1990 by Shanghai Institute of Plant and Biological Physiology. It is a gene recombinant drug prepared by molecular cloning of SAK gene in Escherichia coli. Its biological characteristics are very similar to natural SAK, and r-SAK is a highly fibrin-specific fibrinolysis agent. R-SAK is considered to be one of the most promising thrombolytic drugs due to its high thrombolysis activity (especially in platelet-rich arterial thrombosis), inactivation of system fibrinolysis, and few side effects. Clinical studies have shown that the efficacy of r-SAK in the treatment of AMI is better than urokinase, comparable to RT-PA, and it does not increase serious bleeding complications such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nIn terms of pharmacokinetics, r-SAK has a fast distribution and a long action time in human body. Half-lives of distribution term is 13.30\u00b12.06min and elimination term is 67.94\u00b121.39min when intravenous injection 10 mg r-SAK in 30min. A single bolus of r-SAK as early as possible during the first medical contact (such as prehospital care or primary hospitals or medical centers with conditional PCI) can maximize the time window for reperfusion therapy. R-SAK, a highly effective thrombolytic drug, may shorten the reperfusion time, reduce the size of myocardial infarction and improve the prognosis of the AMI patients.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of single bolus of r-SAK for thrombolytic therapy at the first contact with the patients who are diagnosed acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. It is hypothesized that this therapy can open the culprit artery very early and effectively, reduce thrombus load, reduce slow flow or no flow caused by subsequent PCI, and improve myocardial tissue perfusion.",
                                            "summary": "This study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, excellence clinical trial. Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomly assigned 1:1 to r-SAK group or the control group (normal saline). Emergency coronary angiography was performed and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed 5 days after surgery, followed up to 30 days.\n\nAt present, there is still a lack of clinical evidence on whether thrombolytic therapy is performed for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction <2 hours after the first medical contact and prime PCI. Compared to prime PCI, early thrombolytic therapy can undoubtedly shorten the implementation time of reperfusion strategy to the maximum. For highly effective thrombolytic drugs, it should also shorten the reperfusion time, reduce thrombotic load, possibly reduce the area of myocardial infarction and improve the prognosis of patients. In this study, normal saline was used as the control. To observe the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with single intravenous infusion of recombinant glucokinase (r-SAK) at the first time in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. And the effect of r-SAK on improving myocardial tissue level perfusion, reducing myocardial infarction size, improving cardiac function and clinical prognosis in STEMI patients.",

Neutrophil adhesion to human aortic endothelial cells, quantitative expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of neutrophils, quantitative levels of adhesion molecules on neutrophils and endothelial cells, and neutrophil metabolism, using a Seahorse Analyzer will be evaluated pre- and post-addition of in vitro colchicine. (Group 2)\nThe standard low-dose loading regimen of colchicine (1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg one hour later) will be administered to 20 patients with MI at BHC. Blood will be collected prior to drug administration, 2 to 3 hours after completion of the colchicine load, and 23 to 24 hours after the completion of the colchicine load. Neutrophil adhesion to human aortic endothelial cells, quantitative expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of neutrophils, quantitative levels of adhesion molecules on neutrophils and endothelial cells, and neutrophil metabolism will be evaluated pre- and post-addition of in vitro colchicine (exact markers will be determined based on the results of in viro studies above).

Coronary angioplasty with stent implantation in conjunction with an optimal antitrombotic therapy as abciximab is now considered current standard therapy However, the incidence of stent restenosis in the setting of primary angioplasty remains particularly high, reaching a rate of 27%. A high restenosis rate causes a high re-hospitalization rate for target vessel revascularization and an ensuing increase in cost.In the last years the introduction of drug-eluting stents has drastically reduced the incidence of restenosis in patients not requiring urgent revascularization. This reduced incidence of restenosis occurs without an increase in adverse clinical events over conventional stents and has a very low rate of stent subacute thrombosis. Whether this combination of drug-eluting stents and abciximab might constitute the new optimal therapy for patients with an acute myocardial infarction is unknown. To be able to answer this question, we designed a one year coronary angiographic study in which patients with an acute myocardial infarction eligible for treatment with primary angioplasty and abciximab were randomized to receive either a rapamicine-eluting stent or a conventional bare stent.",

Several studies on rodents have reported administration of sTNFR-Fc, a scavenger of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha at the time of reperfusion would protect against ischemic/reperfusion injury. Also reports had shown that serum TNF-alpha concentration is negatively correlated with a cardioprotective cytokine adiponectin. Adiponectin (Ad) is an abundant protein hormone regulatory of numerous metabolic processes. The major intracellular pathway activated by Ad includes phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which is responsible for many of Ad's metabolic regulatory, anti-inflammatory, vascular protective, and anti-ischemic properties. The aim of the present study was to verify whether the administration of Etanercept, an FDA approved rheumatoid arthritis treating sTNFR-Fc, at the reperfusion time would protect against ischemic/reperfusion injury on patient, and effect serum adiponectin level.",

However, ischemia reperfusion injury, inappropriate ventricular remodeling, and myocardial fibrosis may still be present in STEMI after PCI, which may be related to the inflammatory response in STEMI. Mast cells (MC), their degranulation products and induction of a series of inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the inflammatory response. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between mast cell markers (trypsin, chymotrypsin) levels and prognosis after direct PCI in STEMI patients. We prospectively and continuously included STEMI patients undergoing standard therapy after direct PCI. Clinical data and blood samples were collected and followed up for 1 year to analyze mast cell markers and myocardial infarction size. As well as differences in echocardiography, markers of two-dimensional speck tracking techniques, inflammatory factors and major adverse cardiovascular events, to explore the relationship between mast cells and their products and ventricular remodeling and ischemia-reperfusion injury in STEMI patients, and to provide new ideas for treatment and new basis for optimization of STEMI treatment strategies.",

The study will enroll a total of up to 20 patients, and will be a cooperative effort between LRS and LSU Health Sciences Center - Shreveport.\n\nThe study is being conducted under an IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) that was granted to LRS by FDA (G070141). The primary goal of this trial is to demonstrate the feasibility of cooling AMI patients pre-reperfusion with the ThermoSuit cooling device. The safety of this treatment will be determined by review of a composite of serious adverse events.\n\nConsciously sedated patients will be cooled after entry into the emergency room and prior to percutaneous coronary intervention in the catheterization laboratory. It is hypothesized that the ThermoSuit System will enable cooling of the patient to 34\u00baC after a treatment of 30 minutes or less. Previous research has suggested that cooling of ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients before coronary reperfusion could result in a significant reduction in myocardial infarct size.\n\nIf successful, this study will lead to a pivotal clinical study to investigate the potential for the ThermoSuit cooling treatment to reduce myocardial infarct size. The ultimate goal of these studies is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the use of the ThermoSuit device for the treatment of AMI patients.",

Therefore, the involved lymphocytes represent a novel target for therapeutic interventions. However, there are no established blood-derived biomarkers to predict the quantity and quality of the adaptive immune response to cardiac injury. Multimodal imaging of the heart and immunologic organs might provide such information.\n\nRecent retrospective analysis of patients after MI revealed enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes associated with increased CXCR4 radiotracer accumulation, thereby indicating that CXCR4 PET-based lymph node imaging provides a non-invasive quantitative readout of the local adaptive immune response. These considerations are further fuelled by the fact that, within lymph nodes, CXCR4 is expressed almost exclusively on lymphocytes, whereas various other cell types express CXCR4 within the myocardium.\n\nThis leads to the hypothesis that the size of mediastinal lymph nodes and their respective CXCR4 PET signals correlate with the adaptive immune response to cardiac injury and might provide predictive information for functional cardiac decline during follow-up.\n\nThis prospective clinical study will use multimodal imaging to monitor chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression in the lymph nodes, myocardium, spleen, and bone marrow after acute MI. The combination of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), echocardiography, and positron emission tomography (PET) along with blood collection for immunophenotyping will allow to determine i) if the size of mediastinal lymph nodes and their respective PET-derived CXCR4 signals at baseline correlate with the adaptive immune response to acute cardiac injury; and ii) if they predict cardiac adverse remodelling during longitudinal follow-up.",

                                            "description": "Reperfusion Strategies in ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Network - Sao Paulo Registry.\n\nPreparation and implementation of the ST segment elevation myocardial network in Sao Paulo:\n\nInitially, in 2009 a 24-hour central office for electrocardiogram (ECG) reading was installed at Hospital S\u00e3o Paulo - Paulista School of Medicine to receive EKG's sent from 126 SAMU ambulances, covering the entire S\u00e3o Paulo city area. The ECGs were transmitted to the central office via mobile phone, fixed phone or Internet, and immediately interpreted by a team of cardiologists, by using guidelines for STEMI ECG diagnosis. The EKG reports were sent back to the mobile phone of the transmitting ambulance. With this system in place and working adequately, the Municipal Health Secretariat of S\u00e3o Paulo made the fibrinolytic agent tenecteplase (TNK) available initially in four municipal emergency rooms (ER) of large peripheral hospitals, with a previous history of receiving a large number of patients with AMI (Ermelino Matarazzo ER, Campo Limpo ER, Tatuap\u00e9 ER, and Saboya ER). The medical and nursing teams of these hospitals were trained and updated on the clinical diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes, ECG recognition of STEMI, and indications of thrombolytic agents and primary PTCA in STEMI. A direct and immediate contact, via an exclusive mobile phone line, was established between the advanced ambulances or the ERs and the Coronary Unit of Hospital S\u00e3o Paulo. Thus, a patient diagnosed with STEMI, who was at an ER or in an ambulance and could be in a catheterization laboratory in less than 90 minutes or with contra-indication to thrombolysis was referred for primary PTCA. If the advanced ambulance was very far away or if the estimated travel time for a patient at one of the ERs was longer than 90 minutes, he/she would receive TNK; after thrombolysis, the patient would be immediately transferred to Sao Paulo Hospital, and would undergo either rescue PTCA, if necessary, or cardiac catheterization within 6 to 24 hours, if clinically stable. The dose of TNK ranged from 30 mg to 50 mg, meeting the known criteria for indication and contraindication of fibrinolytic drugs. In addition to TNK, the patients received as adjuvant therapy and according to the Brazilian and international guidelines the recommended doses of morphine, low molecular weight heparin (properly corrected to weight and renal function), IV nitrates and oral medications, such as, aspirin, clopidogrel, statins and beta-blockers.\n\nAn expansion of the primary network was made in 2011 to allow 3 more ER's to be included in the network (Pirituba, Joao XXIII, Servidor Municipal) and one more in 2013 (Vila Maria), summing up at the moment 8 fixed ER units plus SAMU ambulances.\n\nAfter catheterization, patients are maintained in the tertiary hospital if they are in advanced Killip class or have left main or severe LV dysfunction and were referred back to the primary center 24 hours after cath or PCI if stable, with good LV function and 1 or 2 vessel disease.\n\nEstablishing a formal registry:\n\nSince the network's conception, a formal case report form (CRF) form was developed to collect demographics, metrics (times of performance), clinical characteristics, laboratory results, coronary angiography results and outcomes for all patients. This CRF includes now more than 100 variables that are fed exclusively for one person (administrator).\n\nData collection is made by 2 appointed medical co-workers that are responsible for the completion of the CRF and liberation for register on the electronic sheet. CRFs are kept filed with in-hospital ECGs copies.\n\nAn electronic spreadsheet (Excel\u00ae, Microsoft Corp., Santa Rosa, Calif\u00f3rnia - EUA) is maintained in a dedicated central computer at the University and updated weekly by the administrator (principal investigator).\n\nData checks for inconsistencies are made weekly by comparing results of clinical evolution and electronic data as well as information derived from \"overlapping\" columns, established in advance, containing similar data (EKG culprit and cath culprit artery, had PCI performed and type and number of stent utilized, complication yes and no complication item filled out). Source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data is done by comparing the data on the spreadsheet to official medical records if any inconsistency is suspected. A single, experienced PCI person fills out Cath data reports and TIMI and BLUSH flow. Periodic monthly meetings with the total group of professionals involved in the project, reassessing causes and the rate of death and major complications are held previous to send a report to the Municipality with these variables and also detailing where the cases did come from and what the evolution was till hospital discharge.\n\nDefinitions:\n\nAll variables included (history elements, risk factors, clinical presentation data, diagnostic procedure data elements, invasive therapeutic intervention data elements, medication data elements, and outcomes data elements) comply with definitions on \"2013 ACCF/AHA key data elements and definitions for measuring the clinical management and outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes and coronary artery disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on clinical data standards (writing committee to develop acute coronary syndromes and coronary artery disease clinical data standards). J Am Coll Cardiol. 2013 Mar 5;61(9):992-1025. doi: 10.1016/j.jacc.2012.10.005. Epub 2013 Jan 28. PubMed PMID: 23369353\".\n\nThe two pathway established routes involved going directly to the cath lab or receiving TNK and then systematically having cat performed in 3-24 hours. Of those going directly to the catheterization laboratory they didn't have PCI performed if they were found to have no or mild lesions or on the contrary to have distal left main and/or proximal three vessel disease. Additionally, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was defined as initial mechanical reperfusion during cardiac catheterization for a STEMI with no previous use of fibrinolytic drugs or glycoprotein IIB/ IIIa inhibitors. Rescue PCI was defined as an emergency cardiac catheterization due to a suspicion of ineffective thrombolysis, characterized by persistence of pain at an intensity of at least 50% of that at onset or persistence of at least 50% of ST-segment elevation on ECG in the lead maximally initially involved. Pharmaco-invasive strategy was defined as the use of full-dose chemical thrombolysis, followed by routine cardiac catheterization within 6 to 24 hours, even in stable patients with successful reperfusion, with the intention to treat the culprit lesion. After the STREAM trial results in June 2013, patients older than 75 years have received half dosage of TNK.\n\nStatistical analysis:\n\nThis study aims at prospectively collecting data, consecutively, of a large population, submitted to this double route option of STEMI treatment in which current standard medical practice is applied in an organized network. There were no specific statistical tests used when planning the study with the idea that appropriate tests would be applied when looking for specific information of all data collected. No patient to date has been refused to the Registry when the PCI hospital was contacted.\n\nData dictionary:\n\nThe variables included here are the main ones in the Registry, although some of them are further expanded in sub-items allowing more information, like for example, electrocardiographic results and catheterization characteristics. As already mentioned, definitions according to American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force or the European Society of Cardiology on clinical data standards.\n\nName Hospital ID Phone number Age (years) Gender Ethnicity Date/time of admission in the primary hospital (arrival) or ambulance Arrival facility identification Date/time of admission in the tertiary hospital TIMI /GRACE/ ZWOLLE/ CADILAC/ CRUSADE scores Symptoms onset date/time Previous symptoms First ECG date/time TeleECG TNK date/time / location (pre hospital/ ambulance/hospital) Door/needle time Pain/needle time Dual antiplatelet therapy time/type Coronary angiography Date/time; duration Door/balloon time Pain/balloon time Admission arterial blood pressure and heart rate Body Mass Index (MBI) Killip class Creatinine MDRD ECG (multiple characteristics pre and post treatment) Catheterization aspects - type of PCI performed/pharmacologic therapies before and after procedure/ complications (several options) / TIMI and BLUSH grades pre and post intervention STEMI complications Major Bleeding Minor Bleeding Blood Transfusion Ischemic CVA / TIA Hemorrhagic CVA PCR at 3ary Hospital PCR at 1ary Hospital Known Hypothyroidism Length of hospitalization Echocardiographic data Outcomes Final diagnostic Final destination Laboratory screening (arrival or peak and follow-up) - troponin CK/CKMB/ creatinine/ hemogram/ Coagulation tests/ Glucose and Hemoglobin A1c value/ TSH/T3/T4/ Lipids profile/ AST/ALT.

Successful reperfusion rates were obtained in more than 70% and complemented by invasive interventional and PCI in almost all patients. Most of them (77%) received the drug with less than 6 hours after symptoms onset and hospital mortality was 4,5% for this group, while it was around 9% for patients receiving TNK after 6 hours of pain. Again, cardiogenic shock and stroke were more frequent in the latecomers. Mortality rates for patients without cardiogenic shock were very low (under 2%). Late follow up is being proceeded.",
                                            "summary": "At the periphery of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, in-hospital mortality in acute myocardial infarction is estimated to range between 15% and 20% due to difficulties inherent to delayed answer at a large metropolis. As a city with more than 11 million inhabitants, the distribution of emergency services and public hospitals is also heterogeneous, with scarcity in peripheral zones. That heterogeneity of resources also involves the quality of the medical care provided. The possibility of a standard care with fast transfer after thrombolysis and a tertiary backing system for ECG interpretation, catheterization and advanced support could improve this setting.\n\nIn a project initiated in 2010, the S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal Health Secretariat, the Federal University of Sao Paulo/Paulista School of Medicine, the Emergency Mobile Health Care Service arranged a planed system of thrombolysis at peripheral hospitals or at the ambulances with immediate transfer to a unique tertiary center for early angiography and angioplasty of the culprit artery. The protocol uses recommendations of Brazilian and international guidelines, and is the same adopted for the management of ST elevation myocardial infarction at Paulista School of Medicine regarding the indications for thrombolytic agents, primary and rescue percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and pharmacoinvasive therapy.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is that a network to provide the best care for patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction will reduce mortality rates.\n\nThe main purpose of this registry is to provide demographics, metrics and results of this experience, maintaining complete records of clinical, laboratory and coronary angiography data of all patients allowing short-term outcome analysis of various variables in a large population. Additionally, follow-up outcomes will be provide in a sub-group of patients keeping their health care at the University or able to be tracked.\n\nAll clinical endpoints of main interest will be assessed as single or composite endpoints for evaluation at different time intervals.",

According to WHO, 30 % of deaths caused by MI could be prevented if the populations adhere to official guidelines for physical activity. However, secondary prevention trials in MI patients have been of insufficient size or quality to provide conclusive evidence that physical activity reduces the risk of death or recurrent cardiovascular diseases. NorEx is the first study able to provide such evidence.\n\nNorEx is a registry-based prospective, three-arm, randomized multicenter secondary prevention clinical trial with blinded end-point evaluation (PROBE design). The aim of the study is to investigate whether, and to what extent, moderate to high intensity supervised physical activity will reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease and death among people who have suffered a myocardial infarction. The intervention group consists of Approximately 3185 participants who will be trained to exercise for 4 years under supervision of a personal trainer. The study design includes two control groups each consisting of approximately 3200 patients.The primary composite endpoint is time to all-cause death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, whatever comes first during 4 years of follow-up. The study is powered to detect a 20 % difference in the incidence of the primary endpoint between the intervention group and the control groups. Novel health IT technology was specifically designed for NorEx, including a smart watch, a NorEx mobile application and a manager portal which allows the trainers to interact with the participants. Follow-up of the participants will be through national health registries for up to 10 years after study completion.",

COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,. Among patients with COVID-19, there is a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, and >7% of patients experience myocardial injury from the infection (22% of critically ill patients). Although angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 serves as the portal for infection, the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers requires further investigation.\n\nHowever, much like any other respiratory tract infection, pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CV risk factors enhance vulnerability to COVID-19. Further, COVID-19 can worsen underly- ing CVD and even precipitate de novo cardiac complications.\n\nPreliminary reports suggest that haemostatic abnormalities, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), occur in patients affected by COVID-19. Additionally, the severe inflammatory response, critical illness, and underlying traditional risk factors may all predispose to thrombotic events, similar to prior virulent zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks CMR is the reference non-invasive standard for cardiac function and tissue characterization and may offer an effective and efficient diagnostic imaging choice to obtain critical information for clinical decision-making.",

Recent advances in MRI have the potential to reveal new insights into the evolution and functional significance of myocardial injury and repair.\n\nHere, we will study at least 300 consecutive patients with acute ST elevation MI (STEMI) and focus on oedema, scar and bleeding in the heart using MRI in patients managed by emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Cardiac MRI scans will be performed at 1.5 Tesla (MAGNETOM, Siemens Healthcare). MRI will be used to assess initial heart function and injury. Myocardial salvage and haemorrhage are prioritised outcomes. Novel MRI methods will also be used to quantify the extent of myocardial jeopardy representing the initial area-at-risk (AAR), and the nature of this injury (strain, haemorrhage). The MRI methods will include T1, T2 and T2* relaxometry (mapping). Secondly, we will assess coronary artery disease severity by angiography and coronary artery function at the time of the heart attack treatment using a pressure-sensitive coronary guidewire (St Jude Medical). This wire can be used instead of the usual coronary wire and can provide information on heart injury, which can be linked in turn to the MRI findings. All of this information will be linked with health outcomes in the longer term.\n\nWe hypothesise that myocardial salvage, oedema, haemorrhage, and strain as revealed by MRI, have functional and prognostic significance. In all patients MRI will be performed at baseline (~day 2) and again at 6 months. In a subgroup of 30 patients, MRI will be performed on days <12 hours, and days 2, 7-10 days and 6 months post-MI. A blood and urine sample and quality of life will be obtained at baseline and at 6 months post-MI. Clinical outcomes (e.g. rehospitalisation, death) will be assessed at the end of the study (minimum 1 year) and again during longer term follow-up (minimum 3 years, maximum 20 years) by electronic linkage through central National Health Service (NHS) and government health records in order to determine the long-term prognostic significance of our initial observations with angiography, MRI and the pressure wire. The main statistical analyses will be conducted by an independent trials unit statistician.",

The nature and significance of heart injury after a heart attack is incompletely understood. We propose a 'natural history' study of heart attack injury using contemporary MRI methods. In a large hospital in the West of Scotland, heart attack patients will be invited to have at least two MRI scans and also continue with life-long follow-up. The results from the MRI scans will be assessed with all of the other clinical information obtained at the time of the heart attack and during follow-up. The results of our study should provide new insights into heart attack injury and these results should help improve how heart attack patients should be treated.",

According to the design, there were three points in the study: zero point - the first day of hospitalization of the patient in the hospital; the first point - day 30 of MI development; the second point - 12 months from the time of AMI development. At all stages of the study we performed the examinations stipulated by the standard of care for patients with acute myocardial infarction, clinical guidelines and dissertation research protocol: clinical status of the patient (evaluation of complaints, objective examination), laboratory tests (total blood count (TBC), total urine analysis (UPE), biochemical blood analysis (BX), instrumental examinations (ECG, chest radiography (RGCT)). Coronarography followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), EchoCG and determination of molecular genetic markers were also performed at stage 0. At any stage in the presence of cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities, Holter electrocardiography monitoring (HM-ECG) was performed; and a 6-minute walk test was performed at the 1st and 2nd points.\n\nVerification of the diagnosis of AMI was performed according to the criteria of the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction, which summarizes the opinion of experts of the World Heart Federation (WHF), American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC) and European Society of Cardiology (EOC, ESC) (2018). The dissertation work included patients who met the criteria for acute type 1 MI, which included elevated cardiac troponin levels above the 99th percentile of the upper reference value, in combination with at least one additional feature: 1) a characteristic clinical picture of acute myocardial ischemia; 2) new ECG changes suggestive of ischemia; 3) a pathologic Q-wave on the ECG; 4) imaging findings confirming new areas of myocardial ischemia; and 5) presence of infarct-related artery thrombosis (ICA) on CAG. Verification of the diagnosis of acute and chronic heart failure (OSF, CHF) was performed on the basis of clinical recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology (EOC, ESC) (2016, 2021), combined recommendations of the Society of Heart Failure Specialists (SHF), Russian Society of Cardiology (RSC) and Russian Scientific Medical Society of Physicians (RSMOT) (2018). The classification of CHF according to the stages of the disease (Strazhesko-Vasilenko, 1935) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was used, also the heart failure classification of the New York Heart Association (NYHA, 1964) was used to assess the severity of symptoms. We used Killip classification of acute heart failure.\n\nInstrumental methods of investigation ECG was recorded in 12 leads (6 standard and 6 thoracic leads) using \"Megacart-400\" (Siemens) in the first minutes of hospital admission, then once a day until subacute period of STEMI formed, and then once every three days. Echocardiography was performed on admission to the hospital, on the 30th day from the development of MI, and 1 year later on a Phillips ie33 device (Philips Ultrasound, USA) from the standard position, in the left side of the patient, using a 2-4 MHz ultrasound matrix transducer. The technique was performed in M- and B-modes, pulse-wave, continuous-wave Doppler, color Doppler mapping, tissue Doppler and color Doppler M-mode (Color M-mode). The following parameters were determined: PV - ejection fraction (Simpson, 1989. ), FV - end diastolic volume, CSV - end systolic volume, ESR - end systolic size, CDD - end diastolic size, FDi - end diastolic index, CSI - end systolic index, DLA - mean pulmonary artery pressure, FDD - end diastolic pressure, SW - stroke volume, MM - myocardial mass, IMM - myocardial mass index, LP - left atrium, RAP - right atrium, RV - right ventricle, VIR - isovolumic relaxation time, E - LV early diastolic filling rate, A - left ventricular late diastolic filling rate, E/A - ratio of early and late transmitral flow, DT - time of early diastolic filling slowdown, AT - time of early diastolic filling acceleration, ET - ejection period, Em - myocardial early diastolic motion rate, Am - velocity of late diastolic myocardial motion, Em/Am - ratio of velocities of early and late diastolic myocardial motion, E/e' - ratio of E-wave blood flow on mitral valve to E'-wave (ratio of early mitral valve ring motion), pulmonary vein S blood flow, pulmonary vein D blood flow, dE and dA - parameters of duration of early diastolic filling, IVCT - isovolumic time of RV contraction, Sfcmc - mitral valve fibrous ring velocity, VpvA - maximum diastolic retrograde flow velocity, SRMP - early mitral flow velocity, diastolic stiffness, Tei index - sum of isovolumetric contraction and isovolumetric relaxation times divided by ventricular ejection time, Em/SRMP - ratio of early diastolic transcuspidal flow velocity to its rate of spread. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated using the formula: LVEF = (QDO - QSO/QDO) 100% (according to Simpson's method). The presence and degree of dyskinesia of necrosis zone and scar changes, aneurysm, papillary muscle lesions and myocardial rupture zones were also determined by standard technique, in two-dimensional and one-dimensional modes and in pulse and continuous-wave Doppler Echo-CG modes. Selective CAG was performed within the first 24 hours after the patient's admission to the hospital on an INNOVA 3100 angiographic machine (USA) with access through the radial artery using standard Judkins left (Jl 4.0) and Judkins right (Jl 4.0) catheters, using X-ray contrast agents (ultravist, Gadovist). Transilluminal balloon angioplasty with stenting of the symptomatic artery was performed when hemodynamically significant stenosis exceeding 65% was diagnosed using the technique of direct stenting.\n\nPreparation of DNA preparations DNA extraction from blood was performedby phenol-chloroform extraction. Five to six volumes of buffer A (10 mMTris-HCl, pH=7.5; 10 mM NaCl; 3 mM MgCl2) were added to 1 volume of blood sample and clots were rubbed in a homogenizer. After centrifugation at 2500g for 15 min, the precipitates were washed three times with buffer A and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (10 mM EDTA; 100 mM NaCl; 50 mM Tris HCl, pH=8.5). After adding SDS to 0.5% and proteinase E to 200 \u03bcg/mL, the mixture was incubated for 12 hours at 56\u00b0C. Deproteinization was performed sequentially with phenol-chloroform mixture (1:1), water-saturated phenol,phenol-chloroform mixture (1:1), and chloroform. DNA was precipitated by adding NaCl solution to 1 M and 1 V isopropyl alcohol. After that, the solution was cooled for 1 h at -20 \u00b0C. The precipitate obtained by centrifugation on an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 12000g for 15 min was washed three times with 75% ethanol followed by centrifugation for 5 min. 12000g and, after drying at 56 \u00b0C, dissolved in deinanilized water to a DNA concentration of 0.5 \u00b5g/\u03bcl.Genotyping of polymorphisms was performed using real-time PCR according to the manufacturer's protocol (TaqMan probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) on a StepOnePlus instrument. They were selected according to the results ofinternational full genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which confirmed the association of these SNPs with coronary heart disease (CHD),development of heart failure.\n\nStatistical methods of material processing The influence of clinical, demographic, functional, biochemical, markers not and treatment methods on the development of acute, hospital and distant postinfarction chronic heart failure was assessed by odds ratio.\n\nStatistical analysis of molecular genetic data was performed using SPSS 22.0 software package. the first step was to determine the frequencies of genotypes and alleles of the studied CHF in ACS patients with elevated cardiospecific markers and in the comparison group, where cardiospecific markers were within normal limits; then we assessed the compliance of genotype frequencies with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in control group (Chi-square criterion). Comparison of the level of quantitative indices in carriers of different genotypes was performed after checking the normality of the distribution of these traits by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the traits met the criteria of normal distribution, a single-factor analysis of variance was used. Significance of differences between the two genotypic classes was additionally checked using the t-test for two independent samples. The significance of differences between the two genotypic classes was additionally tested with the Mann-Whitney test for two independent samples if the investigated trait did not meet the criteria of normal distribution, comparison of the level of this trait among the carriers of different genotypes was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The association of SNPs with risk factors related to categorical variables was tested with conjugation tables using Pearson's chi-square test. In the case of four-field tables, we compared samples by genotype and allele frequencies using Fisher's exact two-sided criterion. The risk of disease outcome/risk factor for a particular allele or genotype was calculated as odds ratio.\n\nCorrelation, factor and regression analysis methods were used to develop mathematical models for predicting the risk of postinfarct CVD. The first two groups of methods were used to identify significant independent variables (attributes) that correlate well with the probability of an adverse outcome, but weakly correlate with each other (to exclude multicollinearity of the model). Regression analysis methods were used to choose the structure of the regression model and to estimate its coefficients. Two coefficients, which have a simple interpretation, were used to test the adequacy of the constructed model:\n\nsensitivity coefficient;\nspecificity coefficient;\ncoefficient of accuracy.",
                                            "summary": "Introduction Despite significant progresses in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and the development of reperfusion treatment methods, heart failure still often complicates its course. There are three types of postinfarction heart failure: occurring in the acute period, during hospital treatment and after discharge. Factors contributing to heart failure during hospitalization for MI and after discharge include comorbidity of the patient, worsening of pre-existing CHF and comorbidities. In the last decades we can observe higher level of myocardial percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), improvement of pre-hospital care, which decreased mortality and HF; however, the proportion of HF patients with preserved ejection fraction increased. All these factors determine the urgency of the studied problem.\n\nPurpose of the study To identify the most significant factors contributing to the development of acute and subacute heart failure after myocardial infarction Materials and methods Retrospective and prospective non-randomized parallel-group analysis of 186 suffered MI (mean age 63.5 y) during one year was performed in this work, and in the main group of patients (86 patients) at 30 days after MI, chronic heart failure over 2F by NYHA was confirmed, and in comparison group (100 patients) CHF was either absent or did not exceed 2F by NYHA. The diagnosis of MI and CHF was made according to national and European guidelines. Both groups received standard therapy for CHF: ACE inhibitors/angiotensin 2/angiotensin receptor antagonists and neprolysin inhibitor (ARNI), \u03b2-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (AMCR), SGLT2-receptor inhibitors; anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, statins, diuretics if necessary were also used.\n\nOne year after discharge, clinical outcomes were assessed: cardiovascular mortality, repeated hospitalizations due to decompensation of CHF, death from other causes, stroke, repeated myocardial infarction, unscheduled coronary revascularization; telephone contacts were made every month, repeat visits to the clinic - one year later. The results were based on the information collected in the course of telephone contacts and via e-mail; hospitalizations were also monitored by querying the databases of medical institutions.",

Therefore, CARIM cohort will offer a great opportunity of describing the interactions between myocardial infarction and surrounding environment (clinical, social and professional). This cohort will use complementary state of the art approaches (cardiac imaging including Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and echocardiography, biomarkers, proteomic, genetic and pharmacogenetics) with strong interactions between the different partners. Therefore CARIM cohort should help to obtain a modeling of the determinants of the MI size.\n\nThe investigators expect that CARIM cohort will provide new imaging or biological markers that may bring early information regarding the severity of lethal reperfusion injury.\n\nBy optimizing the knowledge on infarct injury in addition with a 5-year clinical and echographic follow-up, this cohort will better stratify the prognosis after MI and will therefore give new insights in identifying patients at higher risk of left ventricular remodeling and subsequent heart failure. It will therefore help and emphasize prevention messages and patients' education. The aim is to translate this information directly into patient care by using the science generated by this project to develop new management guidelines and novel clinical tools (confounder-annotated database, imaging and biological biomarkers). This cohort may have additional impact in patient care by adapting the treatment to patient-related confounders (age, diabetes...), genetic polymorphisms and thus personalizing health care to individuals.\n\n3.2 MAIN OBJECTIVE\n\nThe investigators main objective is to create a prospective cohort of 2,000 patients (CARIM cohort) with a first myocardial infarction and undergoing reperfusion therapy in order to evaluate the impact of patient-related confounders on myocardial infarct size and LRI in order to further design a modeling of myocardial infarct size.\n\nFor this purpose, CARIM cohort will be associated with the creation of a non-invasive cardiac imaging data-bank (MRI and echocardiography) in addition with a large bio-bank relying on existing biological certified platforms (i.e. BRC network).\n\nThis cohort will provide a population of first acute MI, optimally characterized in terms of comprehensive clinical and angiography phenotype, specifically characterized by CMR in terms of infarct size and LRI and by echocardiography in terms of myocardial regional function and left ventricular remodeling.\n\n3.3 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES\n\nEvaluate the specific impact of myocardial infarct injury on myocardial regional function and left ventricular remodeling (defined by an increase in LV end-diastolic volume > 20% between week 1 and month 12 post-MI by echocardiography).\nEvaluate the power of the myocardial infarct injury in predicting cardiovascular events (rehospitalizations, reinfarction, occurrence of HF, transplantation, arrhythmias, death) in a 5-year patient follow-up.\nTest the value of established or newly identified plasma/serum biomarkers to identify LRI and to predict post-MI LV remodeling and progression towards CHF during a 5 year follow-up.\nThis cohort aims ultimately at defining the profile of the MI patient population to be used for future trials implementing new protective interventions targeting LRI.",

AMI was defined using the European Society of Cardiology / American College of Cardiology guidelines. Exclusion criteria were the following: 1) presence of mitral stenosis or prosthetic valve, 2) more than mild severity of aortic/mitral valvular problem, 3) any abnormality of atrial septum (e.g., atrial septal defect or aneurysm), 4) rhythm other than sinus rhythm and 5) lack of informed consent. Finally, 521 patients participated in this study and were under final analysis. All patients and controls gave written informed consent to participate in the study, and the study was approved by the institutional review board at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital.\n\nCardiac catheterization: Before catheterization, all patients received 300 mg of aspirin and 300 mg of clopidogrel. After detail explanation and informed consent, patients were subjected to diagnostic coronary angiography via a femoral approach following intravenous injection of unfractionated 7500 U heparin. There were 46 cases required coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with/without other repair procedures due to failed percutaneous coronary intervention procedure, severe multiple vessel disease, left main lesion, cardiac rupture, severe mitral regurgitation or post-MI ventricular septal defect. All other patients were treated successfully by primary PCI and stenting. Eight patients who had initially received primary PCI were later treated by CABG due to failure of the procedure, severe multiple vessel disease or complications (the 46 CABG patients cited above included these eight patients). Coronary angioplasty and stenting were performed for just the culprit lesion using standard techniques and bare-metal stents in all patients. The decision to use glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was left to the discretion of the treating physician. The measurements of LVFP were performed via a fluid-filled pig-tail catheter placed into the LV after coronary angiography if PCI was not indicated or after primary PCI. The LVFP was continuously recorded (50 mm/s) by a 6-F pigtail catheter placed at the apex of the left ventricle and was taken from 3 to 5 end-respiratory cycles if patients could tolerate breath holding. The LVFP value was calculated as the mean of at least 3 consecutive cardiac cycles.\n\nEchocardiographic and myocardial tissue Doppler measurements: Echocardiography was performed immediately after LVFP measurements. All studies were performed by experienced sonographers and the results were reviewed by staff cardiologists with advanced echocardiography training. Left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated using Simpson's method for biplane images. Pulsed-wave tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) was performed using spectral pulsed Doppler signal filters, by adjusting the Nyquist limit to 15 - 20 cm/s (which approximated the myocardial velocities) and using the minimum optimal gain. In the apical views, a 3-mm, a pulsed-wave Doppler sample volume was placed at the level of the mitral annulus over the septal, lateral and inferior borders. Pulsed-wave TDI results were characterized by a myocardial systolic wave (Sm) and 2 diastolic waves: early (Em) and atrial contraction (Am). The pulsed-wave TDI tracing was recorded over 5 cardiac cycles at a sweep speed of 100 mm/s and was used for offline calculations. Average Em of septal and lateral mitral annulus was chose to estimate LVFP by the method of mitral E/Em.\n\nMeasurement of LA volume: All volume measurements were calculated from apical four- and two-chamber views using the biplane area-length method. The LA volumes were measured at three points: 1) immediately before the mitral valve opening (maximal LV volume or Volmax); 2) at onset of the P-wave on electrocardiography (pre-atrial contraction volume or Volp); and 3) at mitral valve closure (minimal LV volume or Volmin). The LA distensibility was calculated as (Volmax - Volmin) / Volmin. The LA ejection fraction was calculated as (Volp - Volmin) / Volp. In all patients, LA volumes were indexed to body surface area (BSA).\n\nFollow-up: During index hospitalization, only cardiovascular death was deemed an event. A follow-up survey assessing inhospital mortality and hard events was carried out after discharge of index hospitalization. Sudden cardiac death, death related to cardiovascular problem, and any hospitalization related to heart were defined as hard event. Death within 1 hour of the onset of acute illness or sudden collapse with unknown cause was diagnosed as sudden cardiac death. Follow-up was performed between December 2007 and February 2010 by telephone interviews, medical record reviews, and home visits.\n\nInterobserver variability: In the first fifty enrolled cases, Volmax, Volmin, and Volp were measured by two independent observers. Interobserver variability was calculated as the difference between the values obtained by the two observers divided by the mean. Interobserver difference and variability of Volmax were 4.1\u00b15.4 ml and 6.6\u00b18.7%, respectively. Interobserver variabilities and differences, were 8.1\u00b18.9% and 2.9\u00b13.2 ml for Volmin, 6.7\u00b17.4% and 3.1\u00b13.4 for Volp, respectively. Therefore, interobserver variabilities in LA distensibility and LA ejection fraction measurements were 7.8\u00b16.6% and 3.1\u00b13.2%, respectively.\n\nStatistical analysis: The SPSS software was used for all statistical analyses. Baseline characteristics of the study patients were grouped according to quartile of LA distensibility. All continuous variables were presented as means \u00b1 standard deviation. Analysis of variance and post hoc test for unpaired data were used to evaluate the significance of differences between groups. A p vale of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Comparison of clinical characteristics was performed by chi-square analysis for categorical variables. Event-free survival curves were generated by means of Kaplan-Meier estimates, and differences in survival were compared with use of the log-rank test. To evaluate the effect of different levels of LA distensibility on in-hospital mortality, and hard events, relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were calculated as hazard ratios derived from the Cox proportional-hazards model. Multivariate models were fitted with use of the available clinical covariates. The relationship curve between LA distensibility and LVFP was estimated using SPSS software. Bivariate analysis, simple correlation and linear regression were used when appropriate. Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was also performed to assess the sensitivity and specificity for predicting elevated LVFP (> 15 mmHg).",
                                            "summary": "Left atrial volume (LAV) provides the significant prognostic information in the general population and patients with heart disease, including acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Large left atrial volume, which represents chronic diastolic dysfunction, is associated with poor outcome, regardless of systolic function. Thereby, LAV provides a long-term view of whether or not the patient has the disease of diastolic dysfunction, regardless of whatever loading conditions are present at the time of the examination, as the hemoglobin A1C in diabetes. However, whether left atrial (LA) parameters could correlate with LVFP and reflect short-term change in left ventricular filling pressure(LVFP) remains unknown. Only one article of our team confirmed the relationship between LAV and LVFP in patients with severe mitral regurgitation by simultaneous echocardiography-catheterization. The prior report proposed a new parameter, LA distensibility, and disclosed its logarithmic relationship with LVFP. The LA distensibility precisely indicated rapid change in LVFP of patients with acute severe mitral regurgitation, and was even superior to mitral E/Em (early-diastolic mitral inflow velocity divided by early-diastolic mitral annular velocity). As left atrial pressure rises to maintain adequate left ventricular diastolic filling, increased atrial wall tension tends to dilate the chamber and stretch the atrial myocardium. Therefore, the smaller left atrial stretchability, the more pressure left atrium (LA) faces to. The first objective of this study was to test the value of LA distensibility for assessing LVFP, particularly in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The second objective was to assess the prognostic value of LA distensibility.",

Male patients as well as patients with previous coronary heart disease or little regular exercise are at increased risk.\n\nPossible additional mechanisms of exercise induced myocardial infarction are vasospasm and changes in blood clotting.\n\nChanges in the ambient temperature (warm to cold) can also induce vasospasm which might result in reduced perfusion and plaque rupture. It seems that male patients are more involved than female patients.\n\nTaking the exercise and the ambient temperature changes into consideration, heavy snowfall with consecutive snow shoveling is an augmented risk for acute myocardial infarction.\n\nThe rationale of the study is to test if the above mentioned constellation of environmental factors as well as potential increased exercise have a significant and independent impact on the incidence of myocardial infarctions",

However, other studies failed to show this correlation.\n\nWith respect to nitric oxydes the majority of published studies detected a significant correlation with myocardial infarction, too, although a highly ranked publication failed to show the same result. In addition data on the impact of sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide concentration on cardiac events is very heterogeneous.\n\nPublished data indicates additive effects of age and other epidemiological variables suggesting the need of a multivariate analysis.\n\nThe rationale of the study is to test if the above mentioned air pollution factors have a significant and independent impact on the incidence of myocardial infarctions",

France is currently facing the COVID-19 wave with more than 131 863 confirmed cases and almost 25 201 deaths. Systems of care have been reorganized in an effort to preserve hospital bed capacity, resources, and avoid exposure of patients to the hospital environment where COVID-19 may be more prevalent. Therefore, elective procedures of catheterization and programmed hospitalizations have been delayed. However, a significant proportion of procedures within the catheterization laboratory such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina are mandatory and cannot be postponed. Surprisingly, invasive cardiologist noticed a drop in STEMI volume without reliable data to confirm this impression. Furthermore, a recent single center report in Hong Kong pointed out longer delays of taking care when compared to patients with STEMI treated with percutaneous intervention the previous year. These data are at major concern because delay in seeking care or not seeking care could have detrimental impact on outcomes.",

This complication occurs, for 70% of cases, at the patient's residence, within 30 minutes following the thoracic pain. Emergency care often comes too late and allows only 2% of the patients having a heart failure to be revitalized.\n\nAt equal sex, age and clinical status, patients may or not develop ventricular rhythm disorders. Then, the notions of risk background and genetic disposition should be investigated.\n\nNo prospective study has been conducted on a sufficient number of patients yet. Such a study and the recent development of new genetic technologies will help identifying markers of sudden death risk at the acute phase of myocardial infarction.\n\nThe study we are implementing will increase knowledge on sudden death mechanisms at the acute phase of myocardial infarction. The analysis of phenotypic/genotypic relations will lead to an identification of new risk markers. Further evaluations of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies will be possible on the basis of this trial.\n\nVentricular fibrillation at the acute phase of myocardial infarction follows a polygenic determinism. The genes involved in this electrical trouble are those which lead to the expression of potassic, calcic and sodic channels of ventricular myocytes: KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, PRKAG2, RyR2, PKP2, DSP, CASQ2, CACNA1C, and FKBP1B.\n\nAn association of a favourable genetic background and ischemia represents a cause for ventricular arrhythmia as a complication of myocardial infarction.\n\nHaplotypes or genes considered as new markers for sudden death risk of ischemic origin will be searched.",

The second phase will concern the genotype/phenotype analysis and the identification of polymorphisms associated with a sudden death risk after a myocardial infarction.\n\nThis study will allow a better knowledge of the mechanisms of sudden death and the identification of new risk markers.",

Following the acute event, it is difficult to predict which patients are at risk of further problems, such as heart failure and is therefore difficult to know which patients need more aggressive/intensive treatment and monitoring.\n\nThere needs to be a test which is safe, reliable and reproducible that can be used shortly after a heart attack to both predict future cardiac events and to allow the efficacy of new treatments to be assessed.\n\nMyocardial oedema (swelling of the heart muscle) has been demonstrated using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR), to occur following a heart attack and has been suggested as a marker for future cardiac events. The optimum time to perform this scan, the method of data analysis and it's effectiveness as a predictor of future cardiac events has not been adequately assessed.\n\nThis trial will assess the amount and natural time-course of oedema in the first 10 days following a heart attack. It will also correlate the amount of oedema with the size of scar (damaged heart muscle) and left ventricular ejection fraction (heart function) at 3 months to assess if it is a predictive marker.",

Indeed, PPCI is associated with a rapid restore of coronary flow and with a better outcome compared to pharmacological therapy. However in a sizable proportion of patients PPCI achieves only epicardial coronary artery reperfusion but not myocardial reperfusion, a condition known as no-reflow. A series of consistent data has clearly shown that no-reflow has a strong negative impact on outcome, negating the potential benefit of PPCI. No-reflow may be caused by the variable combination of 4 pathogenetic components: 1) distal atherothrombotic embolization; 2) ischemic injury; 3) reperfusion injury; and 4) susceptibility of coronary microcirculation to injury. In particular during PPCI emboli of different sizes can originate from fissurated atherosclerotic plaques and occlude the microvascular bed. Several pharmacological, mechanical or technical strategies have been proposed for the prevention and treatment of distal embolization and coronary no-reflow with variable results, but there are no data addressing the possible effect of different stent designs on the distal embolization of thrombotic fragments.\n\nCoronary stents can be divided in open cell or closed cell stents according to their design. Typically, the number and arrangement of bridge connectors differentiate open-cell from closed-cell designs. If adjacent ring segments are connected at every possible junction, the design is classified as closed cell. If some or all of the connecting junction points are removed, the design is classified as open cell. Such a design inherently allows for more flexion between adjacent rings, because fewer connection points allow for greater flexion and conformability. The flexion benefits of an open-cell design have a cost in scaffolding uniformity, just as the scaffolding benefits of a closed-cell design have a cost in flexion and conformability. A previous study, performed in patients who underwent carotid stenting, showed a significant reduction in distal embolization associated with the use of closed cell stents compared to open cell stents. However there are no study comparing the open or closed stent design during percutaneous coronary intervention particularly in condition at high risk of embolization as acute myocardial infarction.\n\nSTUDY HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to determine whether a closed cell stent design may reduce distal embolization and no reflow during PPCI for acute STEMI compared to an open cell stent design. The study population will include all consecutive patients admitted in our hospital for acute STEMI and treated with PPCI within 12 hours from symptom onset.\n\nMETHODS Design This study will be a prospective, randomized trial.\n\nPatient selection Eligibility criteria: patients with an age > 18 years with acute STEMI treated with PPCI within 12 hours from symptom onset and who agree and provide written informed consent. STEMI is defined as chest pain associated with ST-elevation of 1 mm or more in two or more contiguous leads or new left bundle-branch block within 12 hours after the onset of chest pain.\n\nExclusion criteria will be: implanted stent with diameter < 2.5 mm, cardiogenic shock, time from pain onset to PPCI >12 hours, previous thrombolytic therapy (rescue PPCI), inability to provide informed consent.\n\nSubjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria may be enrolled into the study.\n\nInterventional procedure All patients enrolled in this randomized study should be treated according to the standard of care of our centre and according to guidelines.\n\nPharmacological treatment. At admission and before the procedure all patients will be treated with 500 mg of chewable aspirin, with 600 mg of clopidogrel and with 5000 U of unfractionated heparin i.v. Additional intravenous heparin will be administered during the procedure to maintain an activated clotting time of 200-250 seconds with the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or 250-300 seconds without the administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. The administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (preferably intracoronary abciximab) will be left to the operator's discretion but is significantly encouraged. At the end of the procedure and before the final angiography a dose of 1 \u00b5g of nitrate i.c. will be administrated.\n\nAfter the procedure in all cases heparin administration will be interrupted and patients will be treated with low dose of aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day).\n\nProcedure. Direct stenting is encouraged, but the use of predilation is left to operator's discretion. The use of manual thrombectomy before stenting or predilation is mandatory in case of Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow \u22641 or high thrombus burden after crossing the lesion with the wire. In all cases an effort should be made to use a single stent whenever possible. All stent will be deployed at 14 atmosphere for 30 seconds and then in all cases an angiography will be performed. Post-dilatation with over expansion of the stent is discouraged but it is allowed in cases of sub-optimal angiographic results.\n\nStent. Two different stent design will be employed: a closed cell stent (Presillion Plus\u2122, Cordis) and two open cell stents (Driver\u2122 or Integrity\u2122, Medtronic).\n\nRandomization. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the closed cell stent or the open stent cell. Allocation to one of the two stent will be made by means of sealed envelopes containing a concealed computer-generated random sequence which was set in blocks of 20.\n\nIn-hospital assessment and clinical follow-up Laboratory tests: patients will undergo pre-procedural, 12, 24 and 48 hours blood draws to measure creatine kinase (CK), CK-myocardial band (CK-MB) mass, and troponin T as routinely scheduled for all patients in our centre.\n\nElectrocardiogram: A 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be recorded before and after the procedure to evaluate the ST resolution\n\nEND-POINTS Primary end-point: the primary end-point will be the corrected TIMI frame count at the end of the procedure defined as the number of frames required to opacify standardized angiographic landmarks and normalized for vessel length and a composite angiographic and electrocardiographic end-point including angiographic events such as distal embolization, slow-flow (decrease in flow from TIMI 3 to TIMI 2) or no-reflow (decrease in flow from TIMI 2 or 3 to TIMI 0 or 1) and a binary ECG criterion of microvascular reperfusion injury as defined by the presence of persistent (>50% of initial value) ST-segment elevation 30 to 60 min after completion of the procedure as previously described.\n\nSecondary end-points: Secondary end-points will be: the corrected TIMI frame count after stent deployment; a composite angiographic end-point including angiographic events such as distal embolization, slow-flow (decrease in flow from TIMI 3 to TIMI 2) or no-reflow (decrease in flow from TIMI 2 or 3 to TIMI 0 or 1) after stent deployment; the infarct size detect by myocardial enzyme release.\n\nTertiary end-points: in hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, reinfarction, target lesion revascularization)",

All patients will be assessed by a member of the study team during their index admission and will undergo a detailed assessment of their coronary anatomy with either computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), CT calcium scoring and non-invasive fractional flow reserve assessment (CT-FFR) or invasive coronary angiography with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR). The pattern of myocardial injury and its functional consequence will be evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. The investigators will determine the kinetics of cardiac troponin release using serial testing at multiple time points throughout admission, and quantify other proteins and the expression of long non-coding RNA and associated mRNA to identify differences related to the presence of coronary artery disease, which may help to identify new biomarkers.",
                                            "summary": "Myocardial injury is common in patients without acute coronary syndrome, and therefore international guidelines propose a classification of patients with myocardial infarction by aetiology. This differentiates between myocardial infarction due to plaque rupture (type 1) and myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance (type 2) in other acute illnesses. However, these guidelines have not been widely adopted as the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction are not clearly defined. Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction have poor long term outcomes, with at least twice the mortality at five years compared to those with an index type 1 myocardial infarction. Despite the majority of deaths being attributable to non-cardiovascular events, the rate of future type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death is similar regardless of index classification. If this future risk is related to the presence of underlying coronary artery disease, then there may be the potential to improve outcomes through targeted investigation and secondary prevention. The investigators will undertake a systematic evaluation of the mechanism of myocardial injury and the role of coronary artery disease in 100 patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations where the diagnosis is likely to be type 2 myocardial infarction. These studies will help improve the assessment of patients with myocardial injury, refine the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction, and aid the design of future therapeutic trials.",

This is especially so in developing countries such as Mauritius in which optimal therapy for acute myocardial infarction may not be widely available. For example for patients presenting with a heart attack (caused by a blockage in one of the heart blood vessels) the treatment of choice would be to remove the blockage by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using an angioplasty balloon and put a stent (a spring-like structure) to keep the artery opened. However, PCI is not widely available in Mauritius and heart attack patients are given clot-busting therapy to remove the blockage, but this is not as effective as PCI.\n\nTherefore, in this research study we investigate a new cheap treatment that may help protect the heart against damage during a heart attack, called remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), in which a blood pressure cuff is placed on the upper arm and inflated for 5 minute and deflated for 5 minutes a cycle which is repeated 4 times in total in patients presenting with a heart attack. By temporarily depriving oxygen and nutrients to the arm with the blood pressure cuff a protective signal can be relayed to the heart to reduce the amount of damage occurring during the heart attack and thereby prevent the onset of heart failure.\n\nStudy hypothesis: Remote ischaemic conditioning will reduce the amount of damage occurring to the heart muscle during a heart attack..",

However, all the large randomized trials which evaluated the role of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) on survival in primary prevention were based on LVEF values obtained by older techniques like bi-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), angiography or radionuclide scanning. From now, no study has compared the measurements of left ventricular volumes and LVEF obtained by further current techniques after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) particularly after 1 month when ICD could be indicated.",

When compared to bare metal stents, sirolimus-eluting stents were associated with less restenosis and target vessel revascularization (TVR) up until one year of follow-up. , At present, it is unclear whether this also holds for paclitaxel-eluting stents.4,\n\nEverolimus is a sirolimus analogue, an effective anti-proliferative agent that inhibits growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest in the late G1 stage in the cell cycle.\n\nThe objective of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System versus a modified cobalt chromium balloon expandable stent in the setting of primary percutaneous coronary intervention for treatment of patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.\n\nThis study is a prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, two-arm, multi center clinical evaluation.

Cardiac troponin is considered to be a cornerstone in the diagnosis of a myocardial infarction. Heart-type Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (H-FABP) is a new sensitive biomarker for myocardial injury. The effectiveness of using the combination of H-FABP with Troponin to diagnose myocardial injury within 6 hours after the onset of ischemia is well reported. Previous studies in non-surgical patients have associated increased H-FABP with an increased risk of subsequent death and major cardiac events. The prognostic value in cardiac surgery patients has not been studied extensively.\n\nThe objective is to estimate the association between biomarkers of myocardial injury and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Myocardial infarction will be established with both a new and very early marker of myocardial injury (Heart-type Fatty Acid Binding Proteins) as well as to a known early marker of such injury (Cardiac troponin).",

In the US, approximately 6 million people annually undergo evaluation in the ED for acute chest pain. Despite the wealth of knowledge available about acute coronary syndrome (ACS), this condition continues to be among the most difficult to predict or diagnose. Misdiagnoses may lead to discharge of patients with ACS, who should have been admitted as well as costly unnecessary hospitalizations of patients who do not have ACS.\n\nMore than 2/3 of the patients with ACS have unstable angina (UA) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Conventional ECG has low sensitivity of less than 50% in diagnosing these conditions. As the initial ECG in the ED is often non-diagnostic in ACS patients, the diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during its early stages may also be difficult.\n\nAnalysis of high-frequency QRS components (HFQRS), which quantifies changes in the depolarization phase of the cardiac cycle, has been previously reported to be a sensitive method for detection of demand ischemia. Preliminary studies have shown that HFQRS-derived indices can also identify supply ischemia caused by prolonged balloon occlusion, and transient ischemic episodes in patients with chest pain.",

The majority of patients do not have a heart attack (myocardial infarction), and may be safely discharged from the Emergency Department.\n\nThe investigators propose to evaluate whether the use of the HighSTEACS pathway in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome reduces length of stay and allows more patients to be safely discharged from the Emergency Department. This pathways utilizes high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I testing and will rule out myocardial infarction if troponin concentrations are <5 ng/L on presentation, with further testing indicated at 3 hours only in those presenting early or with troponin concentrations between 5 ng/L and the 99th centile.\n\nIn six secondary and tertiary centres across Scotland, the investigators will introduce the pathway as part of a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. Sequential hypothesis testing will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the pathway. The primary efficacy end-point will be length of stay from time of presentation until final hospital discharge and the primary safety end-point will be survival free from type 1 or 4b myocardial infarction or cardiac death from discharge to 30 days. The study population will consist of those patients with cardiac troponin concentrations within the normal reference range (<99th centile) at presentation.",

The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref 09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).\n\nThe use of antipsychotics is associated with a rise in cardiovascular events. Previous studies investigating the effect of antipsychotic agents on the risk of Myocardial Infarction (MI) led to conflicting results with reports of either no association or a positive association. As patient populations for whom antipsychotic agents are indicated differ considerably from healthy comparison populations, confounding by indication could be substantial. Whilst confounding can be accounted for if known and measured, residual confounding remains a potential problem. This study aims to assess the relationship between the risk of MI and recent exposure to antipsychotic agents by using the self-controlled case series method with which we are able to control for fixed confounders. The results of the self-controlled case series method will be compared to the results of a case-control study using the same data to explore the role of confounding by indication.",
                                            "summary": "A number of studies have suggested an association between the use of antipsychotic agents and cardiovascular mortality. However, the relationship between cardiac events and the use of antipsychotic drugs is not clear. Patients experiencing psychoses and in need for antipsychotic agents may be at a higher risk of cardiac events regardless of any effect of antipsychotic medication. Two studies have specifically investigated the association between the use of antipsychotics and the risk of cardiac events using Myocardial Infarction (MI) as an outcome measure, reporting no association and a positive association respectively. This difference in results may be explained by the use of different measures as well as study designs in both studies and because of different limitations with regard to controlling for lifestyle and medical risk factors. This study aims to assess the relationship between the risk of MI and recent exposure to antipsychotic agents by using the self-controlled case series method with which we are able to control for fixed confounders. The results of the self-controlled case series method will be compared to the results of a case-control study using the same data to compare the estimates of both methods.",

Objective: To evaluate the safety of the 6MWT performed on the third day after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods: It's a cross-sectional study, to be accomplished in Hospital S\u00e3o Paulo - Federal University of Sao Paulo. Individuals, of both genders, aged 18 years and over, will be assessed on the third day after acute myocardial infarction. The 6MWT will be performed according to the norms of the American Thoracic Society. The distance covered during the 6MWT will be measured as weel as adverse events.",

However, as many as 50% of CAD patients lack classical risk factors of CAD suggesting the presence of other contributory mechanisms. Inflammation plays a central role in the initiation and growth of the plaques which form in the arteries (atherosclerosis) and lead to CAD3. As such periodontal disease, an inflammatory process leading to progressive destruction of tooth-supporting structures, has been associated with CAD. In vivo pre-clinical studies have shown that bacteria associated with periodontal disease can exacerbate atherosclerosis 7. Numerous clinical studies have explored the association between periodontal disease and CAD at different follow-up times following episodes of myocardial infarction 8-9. However, there are no reports investigating this association during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. In addition the need for rigorous matching of all known CAD risk factors in case control studies has so far been overseen.\n\nRATIONALE FOR STUDY:\n\nThis case-control study aims to compare the health of tooth supporting structures (periodontium) in patients hospitalised for acute myocardial infarction to a control group of patients rigorously matched for known CAD risk factors, age and gender.",
                                            "summary": "Heart attack remains a major cause of death in adult population worldwide and especially within Scotland. A large portion of the general population has an increased risk of suffering from a heart attack because of their genetic make-up, disease profile and lifestyle choices.\n\nLiterature suggests that apart from these known risk factors, long-standing inflammation (reaction of tissues to infection or injury) elsewhere in the body may be responsible for heart attacks. It has been suggested that gum disease may be one such condition. If left untreated, gum disease may expose the entire body to a long-term inflammatory burden where inflammatory molecules can disseminate from the gums into the bloodstream and affect various body structures. This study explores the influence of gum disease on the risk of heart attack by comparing the gum health of participants who recently had a heart attack to the gum health of participants with no history of heart problems after accounting for other risk factors. Findings will provide critical information for the design of our forthcoming study to establish the effect of treatment of gum disease on the risk of heart attack, and its cost-effectiveness. Ultimately this research will tackle another risk factor for heart attacks and thus inform enhancement of public health prevention strategies.",

And about 10% of all emergency department consultations are with symptoms suggestive of AMI, however, only 10% to 20% of them are diagnosed as experiencing an AMI. Rapid and accurate identification of AMI is of paramount clinical importance for subsequent timely and effectively treatment and management.\n\nRecently, the investigators identified microarray analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from AMI animal models and small samples of AMI patients, a molecular signature of AMI involving 5 circRNAs (circRNA_006877, circRNA_015350, circRNA_002969, circRNA_013240, circRNA_004682) was found significantly change in AMI patients and likely serves as candidate serum biomarkers of AMI. Among the 5 circRNAs, circRNA_006877 name of circRNA-Uck2 (cUck2) has more close association with AMI.\n\nTYPE OF STUDY : multicenter diagnostic evaluation Study MAIN PURPOSE OF THE STUDY : To evaluate the diagnostic value of circRNAs in AMI in adults as compared to healthy and unstable angina controls\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES :\n\nassess the ability of cUck2 to discriminate a AMI disease from unstable angina patients in adults.\n\nexplore the relationship between cUck2 and heart function after myocardial infarction PRODUCTS OF THE STUDY diagnostic kit of AMI in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) NUMBER OF PATIENTS : 3 groups with 169 patients will be included Group 1: 66 AMI adult patients Group 2: 56 unstable angina adults Group 3: 56 Witnesses healthy adults INCLUSION LENGTH 36 months DURATION OF THE STUDY 42 months",

At the time of discharge from the coronary care unit, clinical data will be entered. The registry will include approximately 6800 patients.\n\nAs there is no intervention in the registry, the data to be collected are standard for quality assurance purposes and cannot practicably be carried out without waivers of consent and HIPAA authorization, there will be no consent specifically for registry patients at baseline. Systems have been implemented to ensure the registry data will remain confidential. Sites have received IRB approval of waiver of consent and HIPAA for the baseline registry data.\n\nData to be collected will include demographic (including ethnic and race classifications according to NIH guidelines) data and information regarding the index myocardial infarction. Use of beta-blockers at discharge from the coronary care unit will be documented. In addition, beta-blocker use at hospital discharge will be noted. Data for the registry will be obtained from ER notes, admission notes, cardiac catheterization lab reports, medication lists, lab reports, and discharge summaries.\n\nFollow-Up\n\nFollow-up for registry patients will be conducted at year 1 and year 2 post-myocardial infarction. Data may be obtained via medical chart review, phone contact, and Social Security Death Index (SSDI). For follow-up information obtained via chart review or the SSDI, a detailed justification for waiver of HIPAA and consent requirements is attached to this protocol (see appendix 7). If phone contact is required with the patient, we are suggesting the following process:\n\nA letter should be sent out to the patient approximately one week prior to the contact in which the rationale for the study will be provided, as well as a delineation of the patient's right to participate or not to participate (by either providing or not providing the requested information).\nAt telephone contact with the patient, the coordinator will document whether the patient consents to provide the information. If the patient consents, the coordinator will proceed to obtain the requested information.\nIn the event that the participating institution's IRB requires a written, signed consent for this verbal contact, a written consent form template (see appendix 3) is provided.\n\nData collected at follow-up interview will include vital status, beta-blocker use, other cardiac medications and any cardiovascular hospitalizations.",

Women with elevated perceived stress at screening will be enrolled. Patients will complete baseline assessments (self-report questionnaires and 7 days of wrist actigraphy) and then will be randomized to group-based stress management or to enhanced usual care (EUC). Both study arms involve 8 weekly phone sessions delivered by trained facilitators. Following intervention, participants in both study arms will repeat self-report questionnaires and 7 days of wrist actigraphy. Anticipate enrollment of approximately 200 women to meet target of 144 qualified women.",

The risk of recurrent cardiovascular events may be related to persistent elevation of thrombin beyond the index event 2,3\n\nwhich leads to progression of cardiovascular disease by inducing inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis 4. In patients with coronary heart disease, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been explored as secondary prevention strategies and have shown cardiovascular benefits at the cost of higher bleeding events 5,6,7,8.\n\nhoweverLeft ventricular thrombus (LVT) usually appearswithin 1 month after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and mostlyforms after anterior STEMI.9,11Although the prevalenceof LVT after acute myocardial infarction hasdecreased dramatically in modern times due to the progress of reperfusion therapy, LVT incidence in patients with anterior STEMI remains at 4% to 26%.10,12 It complicates acute myocardial infarction and is associated with a higher incidence of poor outcomes.9",
