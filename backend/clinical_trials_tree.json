                                            "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients must have a recurrent supratentorial WHO Grade III malignant glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, ependymoma) or WHO Grade IV malignant glioma, medulloblastoma, or atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) based on imaging studies with measurable disease (\u2265 1 cm and \u2264 5.5 cm). The prior histopathology must be consistent with a World Health Organization (WHO) Grade III or IV malignant tumor confirmed by the study pathologist, Roger McLendon, or his designee.\nThere is no standard of care treatment for children with Grade III/IV gliomas; however, patients must have received some form of definitive treatment, i.e., standard therapy with known clinical benefit, for their initial diagnosis prior to their recurrence/progression. Definitive treatment includes maximal safe resection (if possible) and radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. (Please note that patients who are unable to receive radiation therapy due to genetic disorders that put them at significant risk for radiation-induced secondary malignancies (i.e., Gorlin's syndrome or NF1 mutation) are still eligible to participate).\nDue to the potential implications of the treatment on the developing CNS, all patients must be \u2265 12 years of age and \u2264 21 years of age at the time of entry into the study.\nThe patient must have a Lansky or Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) of \u2265 70% at the time of entry.\n\nLaboratory Studies:\n\nPlatelet count \u2265 125,000 per microliter prior to biopsy. Platelets \u2265 100,000 per microliter prior to infusion;\nProthrombin and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Times \u2264 1.2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) prior to biopsy;\nPositive serum anti-poliovirus titer \u2265 1:8 prior to biopsy;\nCreatinine \u2264 1.2 x ULN prior to biopsy;\nTotal bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5 x ULN prior to biopsy;\nNeutrophil count \u2265 1000 per microliter prior to biopsy;\nHemoglobin \u2265 9 gm/dl prior to biopsy (can be transfused).\nThe patient must have received a boost immunization with trivalent inactivated IPOL\u2122 (Sanofi-Pasteur) \u2265 1 week prior to administration of the study agent.\nAt the time of biopsy, prior to administration of virus, the presence of recurrent tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis.\nA signed informed consent form approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be required for patient enrollment into the study. Patients (if 18 years old) or their parent(s) or guardian(s) must be able to read and understand the informed consent document and must sign the informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study. All children will have to provide assent to the study.\nAble to undergo brain MRI with and without contrast without requiring general anesthesia.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPregnant or breast-feeding. Female patients of child-bearing potential or female sexual partners (who are of child-bearing potential) of male patients must use at least one of the following methods of medically acceptable contraceptives: approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches, implants or infusions), an intrauterine device (IUD), or a barrier method of contraception (such as a condom or diaphragm) used ith spermicide. Because all patients are required to have a boost immunization of trivalent inactivated IPOL\u2122, there should be no risk of transmission of a mother to her fetus after receiving intracranial PVSRIPO. As such, patients who become pregnant after receiving PVSRIPO will continue to be monitored in the same manner, i.e. per protocol, unless the assessment is contra-indicated during pregnancy. Partners who become pregnant will sign a Pregnant Partner Information Form and information regarding the pregnancy and its outcome may be collected.\nPatients with an impending, life-threatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on the assessment of the study neurosurgeon.\nPatients with an active infection requiring intravenous treatment or having an unexplained febrile illness (Tmax > 99.5\u00b0F).\nPatients with known immunosuppressive disease or known human immunodeficiency virus infection.\nPatients with unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions such as severe heart (New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4) or lung (FEV1 < 50%) disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.\nPatients with allergy to human serum albumin.\nCurrent or history of anaphylactic reaction to gadolinium.\nA history of neurological complications due to past PV infection would imply previous virus replication in the CNS. Based on animal studies, previous exposure to poliovirus administered intracerebrally can reduce subsequent virus replication in the CNS.\n\nPatients who have not recovered from the toxic effects of prior chemo- and/or radiation therapy. Guidelines for this recovery period are dependent upon the specific therapeutic agent being used:\n\nPatients who are less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy, unless progressive disease outside of the radiation field or 2 consecutive scans with disease progression or histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor.\nPatients who have received chemotherapy or bevacizumab \u2264 4 weeks [except for nitrosourea (6 weeks) or metronomic dosed chemotherapy such as daily etoposide or cyclophosphamide (1 week)] prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy.\nPatients who have received immunotherapy \u2264 4 weeks prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy.\nPatients with neoplastic lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, intraventricular tumors, pituitary tumors, leptomeningeal disease, or other locations at the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon.\n\nPatients with a diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia, that is:\n\nUndetectable anti-tetanus toxoid IgG\nKnown history of agammaglobulinemia\nPatients who are on dexamethasone receiving > 4 mg/day in the two weeks prior to admission for intra-cerebral delivery of PVSRIPO or who demonstrate worsening steroid myopathy.\nPatients with prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.",

The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)-evaluation period will consist of the first cycle (i.e. first 4 weeks of therapy). Research participants will be evaluated at least once a week during the DLT-evaluation period and at regular intervals thereafter. Standard (e.g., physical exam, blood tests, and disease evaluations) tests will be obtained at regular intervals. Research-associated evaluations (e.g., pharmacokinetic studies, etc.) will also be obtained during therapy.

Despite this terrible and frustrating outcome, continued treatment of this population remains fundamental to improving cure rates. Studying this relapsed population will help unearth clues to why conventional therapy fails and how cancers continue to resist modern advances. Moreover, improvements in the treatment of this relapsed population will lead to improvements in upfront therapy and reduce the chance of relapse for all. Novel therapy and, more importantly, novel approaches are sorely needed. This trial proposes a new approach that evaluates rational combination therapies of novel agents based on tumor type and molecular characteristics of these diseases. The investigators hypothesize that the use of two predictably active drugs (a doublet) will increase the chance of clinical efficacy. The purpose of this trial is to perform a limited dose escalation study of multiple doublets to evaluate the safety and tolerability of these combinations followed by a small expansion cohort to detect preliminary efficacy. In addition, a more extensive and robust molecular analysis of all the participant samples will be performed as part of the trial such that we can refine the molecular classification and better inform on potential response to therapy. In this manner the tolerability of combinations can be evaluated on a small but relevant population and the chance of detecting antitumor activity is potentially increased. Furthermore, the goal of the complementary molecular characterization will be to eventually match the therapy with better predictive biomarkers.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nTo determine the safety and tolerability and estimate the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of combination treatment by stratum.\nTo characterize the pharmacokinetics of combination treatment by stratum.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nTo estimate the rate and duration of objective response and progression free survival (PFS) by stratum.",

We will also be looking at the side effects and risks of this treatment.\n\nYou will receive very high doses of chemotherapy. High doses of chemotherapy can destroy tumor cells, but it can also destroy normal bone marrow cells. These cells produce white blood cells (which fight infection), red blood cells (which carry oxygen) and platelets (which allow your blood to clot). With too few of these cells there is a serious risk of infection and bleeding.\n\nTherefore, before treatment begins, we will collect some of your own blood cells, called peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). These cells help create new blood cells. The PBPCs are frozen and saved while you are being treated. Then at the end of treatment, your PBPCs are thawed and given back to you. These healthy PBPCs will replace the blood cells that the high dose chemotherapy destroys and allow your bone marrow to recover and produce blood cells. In a prior study we treated 69 patients in a similar way. More than half were able to avoid or delay brain radiation. This new study will use a different high dose chemotherapy regimen.",

PBSCs are collected over 3-5 days. Patients who do not mobilize sufficient cells undergo bone marrow harvest.\n\nPatients receive high-dose thiotepa IV over 5 hours on day -2. PBSCs or bone marrow are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 2-3 weeks for a total of 1-4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nQuality of life is assessed at baseline, at every course, then monthly for 6 months, and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\nPatients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.",

Compare survival and time to first progression in patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with radiotherapy with or without adjuvant procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) following surgical resection. II. Investigate the effect of PCV on quality of life and neurologic function in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity of PCV in these patients. IV. Correlate chromosomal lesions (1p and/or 19q, 9p, p53 loss and mutation, amplification of chromosome 7, or loss of chromosome 10) with progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age, extent of resection, performance status, prior surgery, and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Within 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy over 7 weeks to the residual tumor volume. Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I, then begin chemotherapy within 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1, oral procarbazine on days 8-21, and vincristine IV on days 8 and 29. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in stable and responding patients for a total of 6 courses. Patients with disease recurrence may receive 6 additional courses of chemotherapy as above or another modality at the investigator's discretion. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for survival.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 350 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.",

These tumors account for 5 to 10% of adult gliomas and are of special relevance in the neuro-oncology field because of their frequent chemosensitivity (Louis et al. 2016). The genetics of oligodendrogliomas is relatively well characterized but the mechanisms of oncogenesis for these tumors are poorly understood.\n\nAlthough oligodendrogliomas prognosis is usually better than that of other adult glioma subtypes, it remains heterogeneous and there is no effective treatment at recurrence after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Our recent work conducted within the INCa-funded national POLA network has related this clinical heterogeneity to inter-tumoral heterogeneity. Based on a transcriptomic analysis of a large series of oligodendroglial gliomas we identified 3 subgroups, the most aggressive group being characterized by aggressive clinical and molecular pattern. Recent studies, however, have shown a relatively low level of concordance between mRNA and protein expression, emphasizing the need to use proteomic-based approaches to better understand tumor biology. Taking advantage of the POLA cohort, we propose to expand our previous analysis by integrating a proteomic analysis of oligodendrogliomas.\n\nThe aim of this project is to identify drivers of oligodendroglioma subgroups, among which potential druggable targets (i.e receptors, metabolism effectors). For this purpose, the proteomic profiles of 90 oligodendrogliomas will be generated and integrated with transcriptomic, genomic and methylation profiles in order to identify signaling pathways specifically associated with each subtype, especially with the most aggressive one. Associations will be explored between candidate signaling pathways expression and clinical outcomes (survival, progression-free survival, objective response). The relevance of the 2 most promising candidate signaling pathways will be assessed in vitro and in vivo using genetically relevant mouse and xenograft models.\n\nOur project will identify targetable oncogenic pathways associated with poor prognosis that could lead to new therapeutic strategies.",

Pediatric soft tissue tumors (STT) present difficulties for accurate diagnosis since their morphological and immunophenotypic features overlap among the different histological patterns.\n\nThe emergence of new molecular techniques has generated a great advance in the field of solid tumors, particularly in the molecular definition of groups of patients. This fact makes tailor-made treatment feasible, according to the biology of the tumor.\n\nIn particular, in children, the identification of treatment targets is especially important since it may avoid unnecessary sequel in a growing child. This project allows the articulation between basic and clinical research groups, thus consolidating the objective of basic translational research and generating both clinical and basic knowledge about the pathogenesis of pediatric solid tumors in our country.\n\nAim: To standardize and implement a comprehensive multi-level molecular strategy, using medium and high complexity techniques, for the detection of molecular alterations in primary pediatric solid tumors (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma family tumors, soft tissue sarcomas and CNS tumors (gliomas and embryonal)), that can be applied to the diagnosis, prognosis and/or use of targeted therapies against molecular targets in order to provide a tailored therapeutic opportunity.\n\nMaterial and methods: Pediatric cases of solid tumors will be enrolled prospectively. Based on the statistics of the participating centers, 100 samples will be included. From each case, a formalin fixed biopsy will be available and when possible, a fragment will also be preserved at -70\u00baC. Clinical and follow-up data will be obtained from the clinical records.\n\nThe methodological approaches include: 1) Immunohistochemical detection of tumor lineage determinant markers, some of them with predictive value. 2) FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) with break-apart strategy for genes involved in recurrent chromosomal translocations and locus-specific design probes for other unbalanced structural chromosomal structural alterations (amplifications and deletions of genes or chromosomal segments). 3) Real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of fusion transcripts resulting from chromosomal translocations. 4) Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Sanger sequencing analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as targets for therapy. 5) Sanger sequencing analysis of fusions, ins/del as a complement to RT-PCR or FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), 6) Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) with a specific and customized panel containing all necessary genes to define a tumor\u00b4s genomic mutation profile for diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis of pediatric tumors. However, NGS sequencing will only be applied in those cases which could not be resolved with the previous strategies or cases with poor evolution\n\nBased on the above analyses, an integrated analysis algorithm will be developed according to WHO recommendations, but adapted to the facilities of the institution. Molecular findings will be correlated with clinical and histological data",

The less frequent grade A oligodendrogliomas are characterized by no vascular contrast on RMN evaluation comparatively to grade B forms. This benign histological subtype relapses in few cases with a more aggressive histology. To determine these relapsed cases at diagnosis, a collection of tumour begun in February 2004. Then, our study was designed to identify diagnostic molecular and metabolic markers that could eventually be used as a signature characterising grade A versus grade B oligodendrogliomas. The molecular analysis will use genomic techniques like allelotyping study, quantitative real-time PCR, gene sequencing , serial analysis of genomic expression and immunohistochemistry, since the metabolic study will be the spectroscopic examination of in vivo tumour. This study will include paediatric and adult patients followed for oligodendrogliomas, medulloblastomas and gliomas to compare the different tumour signatures. All these results will be correlated to survival and clinical features.",

The prior histopathology must be consistent with a World Health Organization (WHO) Grade III or IV malignant tumor confirmed by the study pathologist, Roger McLendon, or his designee.\nThere is no standard of care treatment for children with Grade III/IV gliomas; however, patients must have received some form of definitive treatment, i.e., standard therapy with known clinical benefit, for their initial diagnosis prior to their recurrence/progression. Definitive treatment includes maximal safe resection (if possible) and radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. (Please note that patients who are unable to receive radiation therapy due to genetic disorders that put them at significant risk for radiation-induced secondary malignancies (i.e., Gorlin's syndrome or NF1 mutation) are still eligible to participate).\nDue to the potential implications of the treatment on the developing CNS, all patients must be \u2265 12 years of age and \u2264 21 years of age at the time of entry into the study.\nThe patient must have a Lansky or Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) of \u2265 70% at the time of entry.\n\nLaboratory Studies:\n\nPlatelet count \u2265 125,000 per microliter prior to biopsy. Platelets \u2265 100,000 per microliter prior to infusion;\nProthrombin and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Times \u2264 1.2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) prior to biopsy;\nPositive serum anti-poliovirus titer \u2265 1:8 prior to biopsy;\nCreatinine \u2264 1.2 x ULN prior to biopsy;\nTotal bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5 x ULN prior to biopsy;\nNeutrophil count \u2265 1000 per microliter prior to biopsy;\nHemoglobin \u2265 9 gm/dl prior to biopsy (can be transfused).\nThe patient must have received a boost immunization with trivalent inactivated IPOL\u2122 (Sanofi-Pasteur) \u2265 1 week prior to administration of the study agent.\nAt the time of biopsy, prior to administration of virus, the presence of recurrent tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis.\nA signed informed consent form approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be required for patient enrollment into the study. Patients (if 18 years old) or their parent(s) or guardian(s) must be able to read and understand the informed consent document and must sign the informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study. All children will have to provide assent to the study.\nAble to undergo brain MRI with and without contrast without requiring general anesthesia.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPregnant or breast-feeding. Female patients of child-bearing potential or female sexual partners (who are of child-bearing potential) of male patients must use at least one of the following methods of medically acceptable contraceptives: approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches, implants or infusions), an intrauterine device (IUD), or a barrier method of contraception (such as a condom or diaphragm) used ith spermicide. Because all patients are required to have a boost immunization of trivalent inactivated IPOL\u2122, there should be no risk of transmission of a mother to her fetus after receiving intracranial PVSRIPO. As such, patients who become pregnant after receiving PVSRIPO will continue to be monitored in the same manner, i.e. per protocol, unless the assessment is contra-indicated during pregnancy. Partners who become pregnant will sign a Pregnant Partner Information Form and information regarding the pregnancy and its outcome may be collected.\nPatients with an impending, life-threatening cerebral herniation syndrome, based on the assessment of the study neurosurgeon.\nPatients with an active infection requiring intravenous treatment or having an unexplained febrile illness (Tmax > 99.5\u00b0F).\nPatients with known immunosuppressive disease or known human immunodeficiency virus infection.\nPatients with unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions such as severe heart (New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4) or lung (FEV1 < 50%) disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.\nPatients with allergy to human serum albumin.\nCurrent or history of anaphylactic reaction to gadolinium.\nA history of neurological complications due to past PV infection would imply previous virus replication in the CNS. Based on animal studies, previous exposure to poliovirus administered intracerebrally can reduce subsequent virus replication in the CNS.\n\nPatients who have not recovered from the toxic effects of prior chemo- and/or radiation therapy. Guidelines for this recovery period are dependent upon the specific therapeutic agent being used:\n\nPatients who are less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy, unless progressive disease outside of the radiation field or 2 consecutive scans with disease progression or histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor.\nPatients who have received chemotherapy or bevacizumab \u2264 4 weeks [except for nitrosourea (6 weeks) or metronomic dosed chemotherapy such as daily etoposide or cyclophosphamide (1 week)] prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy.\nPatients who have received immunotherapy \u2264 4 weeks prior to starting the study drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy.\nPatients with neoplastic lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, intraventricular tumors, pituitary tumors, leptomeningeal disease, or other locations at the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon.\n\nPatients with a diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia, that is:\n\nUndetectable anti-tetanus toxoid IgG\nKnown history of agammaglobulinemia\nPatients who are on dexamethasone receiving > 4 mg/day in the two weeks prior to admission for intra-cerebral delivery of PVSRIPO or who demonstrate worsening steroid myopathy.\nPatients with prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.",

                                            "summary": "Approximately 90% of children with malignant brain tumors that have recurred or relapsed after receiving conventional therapy will die of disease. Despite this terrible and frustrating outcome, continued treatment of this population remains fundamental to improving cure rates. Studying this relapsed population will help unearth clues to why conventional therapy fails and how cancers continue to resist modern advances. Moreover, improvements in the treatment of this relapsed population will lead to improvements in upfront therapy and reduce the chance of relapse for all. Novel therapy and, more importantly, novel approaches are sorely needed. This trial proposes a new approach that evaluates rational combination therapies of novel agents based on tumor type and molecular characteristics of these diseases. The investigators hypothesize that the use of two predictably active drugs (a doublet) will increase the chance of clinical efficacy. The purpose of this trial is to perform a limited dose escalation study of multiple doublets to evaluate the safety and tolerability of these combinations followed by a small expansion cohort to detect preliminary efficacy. In addition, a more extensive and robust molecular analysis of all the participant samples will be performed as part of the trial such that we can refine the molecular classification and better inform on potential response to therapy. In this manner the tolerability of combinations can be evaluated on a small but relevant population and the chance of detecting antitumor activity is potentially increased. Furthermore, the goal of the complementary molecular characterization will be to eventually match the therapy with better predictive biomarkers.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nTo determine the safety and tolerability and estimate the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of combination treatment by stratum.\nTo characterize the pharmacokinetics of combination treatment by stratum.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nTo estimate the rate and duration of objective response and progression free survival (PFS) by stratum.",

We will also be looking at the side effects and risks of this treatment.\n\nYou will receive very high doses of chemotherapy. High doses of chemotherapy can destroy tumor cells, but it can also destroy normal bone marrow cells. These cells produce white blood cells (which fight infection), red blood cells (which carry oxygen) and platelets (which allow your blood to clot). With too few of these cells there is a serious risk of infection and bleeding.\n\nTherefore, before treatment begins, we will collect some of your own blood cells, called peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). These cells help create new blood cells. The PBPCs are frozen and saved while you are being treated. Then at the end of treatment, your PBPCs are thawed and given back to you. These healthy PBPCs will replace the blood cells that the high dose chemotherapy destroys and allow your bone marrow to recover and produce blood cells. In a prior study we treated 69 patients in a similar way. More than half were able to avoid or delay brain radiation. This new study will use a different high dose chemotherapy regimen.",

Compare survival and time to first progression in patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with radiotherapy with or without adjuvant procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) following surgical resection. II. Investigate the effect of PCV on quality of life and neurologic function in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity of PCV in these patients. IV. Correlate chromosomal lesions (1p and/or 19q, 9p, p53 loss and mutation, amplification of chromosome 7, or loss of chromosome 10) with progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age, extent of resection, performance status, prior surgery, and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Within 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy over 7 weeks to the residual tumor volume. Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I, then begin chemotherapy within 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1, oral procarbazine on days 8-21, and vincristine IV on days 8 and 29. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in stable and responding patients for a total of 6 courses.

These tumors account for 5 to 10% of adult gliomas and are of special relevance in the neuro-oncology field because of their frequent chemosensitivity (Louis et al. 2016). The genetics of oligodendrogliomas is relatively well characterized but the mechanisms of oncogenesis for these tumors are poorly understood.\n\nAlthough oligodendrogliomas prognosis is usually better than that of other adult glioma subtypes, it remains heterogeneous and there is no effective treatment at recurrence after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Our recent work conducted within the INCa-funded national POLA network has related this clinical heterogeneity to inter-tumoral heterogeneity. Based on a transcriptomic analysis of a large series of oligodendroglial gliomas we identified 3 subgroups, the most aggressive group being characterized by aggressive clinical and molecular pattern. Recent studies, however, have shown a relatively low level of concordance between mRNA and protein expression, emphasizing the need to use proteomic-based approaches to better understand tumor biology. Taking advantage of the POLA cohort, we propose to expand our previous analysis by integrating a proteomic analysis of oligodendrogliomas.\n\nThe aim of this project is to identify drivers of oligodendroglioma subgroups, among which potential druggable targets (i.e receptors, metabolism effectors). For this purpose, the proteomic profiles of 90 oligodendrogliomas will be generated and integrated with transcriptomic, genomic and methylation profiles in order to identify signaling pathways specifically associated with each subtype, especially with the most aggressive one. Associations will be explored between candidate signaling pathways expression and clinical outcomes (survival, progression-free survival, objective response). The relevance of the 2 most promising candidate signaling pathways will be assessed in vitro and in vivo using genetically relevant mouse and xenograft models.\n\nOur project will identify targetable oncogenic pathways associated with poor prognosis that could lead to new therapeutic strategies.",

The new World Health organization (WHO) 2016 classification, which includes genomic characterization, comprises more than 100 CNS tumor entities and subclasses. In children, glial lineage tumors (gliomas) are the most frequent and comprise astrocytomas, ependymomas and oligodendroglioma, while embryonal CNS tumors are a heterogeneous group of WHO grade IV tumors. Pediatric soft tissue tumors (STT) present difficulties for accurate diagnosis since their morphological and immunophenotypic features overlap among the different histological patterns.\n\nThe emergence of new molecular techniques has generated a great advance in the field of solid tumors, particularly in the molecular definition of groups of patients. This fact makes tailor-made treatment feasible, according to the biology of the tumor.\n\nIn particular, in children, the identification of treatment targets is especially important since it may avoid unnecessary sequel in a growing child. This project allows the articulation between basic and clinical research groups, thus consolidating the objective of basic translational research and generating both clinical and basic knowledge about the pathogenesis of pediatric solid tumors in our country.\n\nAim: To standardize and implement a comprehensive multi-level molecular strategy, using medium and high complexity techniques, for the detection of molecular alterations in primary pediatric solid tumors (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma family tumors, soft tissue sarcomas and CNS tumors (gliomas and embryonal)), that can be applied to the diagnosis, prognosis and/or use of targeted therapies against molecular targets in order to provide a tailored therapeutic opportunity.\n\nMaterial and methods: Pediatric cases of solid tumors will be enrolled prospectively. Based on the statistics of the participating centers, 100 samples will be included. From each case, a formalin fixed biopsy will be available and when possible, a fragment will also be preserved at -70\u00baC. Clinical and follow-up data will be obtained from the clinical records.\n\nThe methodological approaches include: 1) Immunohistochemical detection of tumor lineage determinant markers, some of them with predictive value. 2) FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) with break-apart strategy for genes involved in recurrent chromosomal translocations and locus-specific design probes for other unbalanced structural chromosomal structural alterations (amplifications and deletions of genes or chromosomal segments). 3) Real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of fusion transcripts resulting from chromosomal translocations. 4) Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Sanger sequencing analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as targets for therapy. 5) Sanger sequencing analysis of fusions, ins/del as a complement to RT-PCR or FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), 6) Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) with a specific and customized panel containing all necessary genes to define a tumor\u00b4s genomic mutation profile for diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis of pediatric tumors. However, NGS sequencing will only be applied in those cases which could not be resolved with the previous strategies or cases with poor evolution\n\nBased on the above analyses, an integrated analysis algorithm will be developed according to WHO recommendations, but adapted to the facilities of the institution. Molecular findings will be correlated with clinical and histological data",

Then, our study was designed to identify diagnostic molecular and metabolic markers that could eventually be used as a signature characterising grade A versus grade B oligodendrogliomas. The molecular analysis will use genomic techniques like allelotyping study, quantitative real-time PCR, gene sequencing , serial analysis of genomic expression and immunohistochemistry, since the metabolic study will be the spectroscopic examination of in vivo tumour.

We will also be looking at the side effects and risks of this treatment.\n\nYou will receive very high doses of chemotherapy. High doses of chemotherapy can destroy tumor cells, but it can also destroy normal bone marrow cells. These cells produce white blood cells (which fight infection), red blood cells (which carry oxygen) and platelets (which allow your blood to clot). With too few of these cells there is a serious risk of infection and bleeding.\n\nTherefore, before treatment begins, we will collect some of your own blood cells, called peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). These cells help create new blood cells. The PBPCs are frozen and saved while you are being treated. Then at the end of treatment, your PBPCs are thawed and given back to you. These healthy PBPCs will replace the blood cells that the high dose chemotherapy destroys and allow your bone marrow to recover and produce blood cells. In a prior study we treated 69 patients in a similar way. More than half were able to avoid or delay brain radiation. This new study will use a different high dose chemotherapy regimen.",

PBSCs are collected over 3-5 days. Patients who do not mobilize sufficient cells undergo bone marrow harvest.\n\nPatients receive high-dose thiotepa IV over 5 hours on day -2. PBSCs or bone marrow are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 2-3 weeks for a total of 1-4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nQuality of life is assessed at baseline, at every course, then monthly for 6 months, and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\nPatients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.",

Giving chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplant may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well thiotepa followed by peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplant works in treating patients with malignant glioma.",

Compare survival and time to first progression in patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with radiotherapy with or without adjuvant procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) following surgical resection. II. Investigate the effect of PCV on quality of life and neurologic function in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity of PCV in these patients. IV. Correlate chromosomal lesions (1p and/or 19q, 9p, p53 loss and mutation, amplification of chromosome 7, or loss of chromosome 10) with progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age, extent of resection, performance status, prior surgery, and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Within 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy over 7 weeks to the residual tumor volume. Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I, then begin chemotherapy within 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1, oral procarbazine on days 8-21, and vincristine IV on days 8 and 29. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in stable and responding patients for a total of 6 courses. Patients with disease recurrence may receive 6 additional courses of chemotherapy as above or another modality at the investigator's discretion. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for survival.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 350 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.",

These tumors account for 5 to 10% of adult gliomas and are of special relevance in the neuro-oncology field because of their frequent chemosensitivity (Louis et al. 2016). The genetics of oligodendrogliomas is relatively well characterized but the mechanisms of oncogenesis for these tumors are poorly understood.\n\nAlthough oligodendrogliomas prognosis is usually better than that of other adult glioma subtypes, it remains heterogeneous and there is no effective treatment at recurrence after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Our recent work conducted within the INCa-funded national POLA network has related this clinical heterogeneity to inter-tumoral heterogeneity. Based on a transcriptomic analysis of a large series of oligodendroglial gliomas we identified 3 subgroups, the most aggressive group being characterized by aggressive clinical and molecular pattern. Recent studies, however, have shown a relatively low level of concordance between mRNA and protein expression, emphasizing the need to use proteomic-based approaches to better understand tumor biology. Taking advantage of the POLA cohort, we propose to expand our previous analysis by integrating a proteomic analysis of oligodendrogliomas.\n\nThe aim of this project is to identify drivers of oligodendroglioma subgroups, among which potential druggable targets (i.e receptors, metabolism effectors). For this purpose, the proteomic profiles of 90 oligodendrogliomas will be generated and integrated with transcriptomic, genomic and methylation profiles in order to identify signaling pathways specifically associated with each subtype, especially with the most aggressive one. Associations will be explored between candidate signaling pathways expression and clinical outcomes (survival, progression-free survival, objective response). The relevance of the 2 most promising candidate signaling pathways will be assessed in vitro and in vivo using genetically relevant mouse and xenograft models.\n\nOur project will identify targetable oncogenic pathways associated with poor prognosis that could lead to new therapeutic strategies.",

The less frequent grade A oligodendrogliomas are characterized by no vascular contrast on RMN evaluation comparatively to grade B forms. This benign histological subtype relapses in few cases with a more aggressive histology. To determine these relapsed cases at diagnosis, a collection of tumour begun in February 2004. Then, our study was designed to identify diagnostic molecular and metabolic markers that could eventually be used as a signature characterising grade A versus grade B oligodendrogliomas. The molecular analysis will use genomic techniques like allelotyping study, quantitative real-time PCR, gene sequencing , serial analysis of genomic expression and immunohistochemistry, since the metabolic study will be the spectroscopic examination of in vivo tumour. This study will include paediatric and adult patients followed for oligodendrogliomas, medulloblastomas and gliomas to compare the different tumour signatures. All these results will be correlated to survival and clinical features.",
